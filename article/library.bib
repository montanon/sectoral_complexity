  abstract = {This paper presents a review of the literature concerning the relationship between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and structural transformation in emerging and developing countries based on journal publications over the 2000 to 2020 period. Both outward and inward foreign direct investment by multinationals were found to have strong potential implications for structural change, in the form of knowledge transfer and capabilities upgrading, productivity growth, export promotion, industrial diversification and service sector growth. With rapid development and diffusion of digital technologies, MNEs in the service sector and the digital economy may also open windows of opportunity for developing countries to catch-up in the service sector. The strength and sign of these effects were, however, dependent most prominently on (1) the characteristics of the MNEs and the host countries and (2) the compatibility of the MNEs and the host country. Policy and managerial implications are discussed. A set of areas for future research are also identified.},

	abstract = {The potential for reducing industrial energy demand and `greenhouse gas' (GHG) emissions in the Pulp and Paper sector (hereinafter denoted as the paper industry) has been evaluated within a United Kingdom (UK) context, although the lessons learned are applicable across much of the industrialised world. This sector gives rise to about 6% of UK industrial GHG emissions resulting principally from fuel use (including that indirectly emitted because of electricity use). It can be characterised as being heterogeneous with a diverse range of product outputs (including banknotes, books, magazines, newspapers and packaging, such as corrugated paper and board), and sits roughly on the boundary between energy-intensive (EI) and non-energy-intensive (NEI) industrial sectors. This novel assessment was conducted in the context of the historical development of the paper sector, as well as its contemporary industrial structure. Some 70% of recovered or recycled fibre is employed to make paper products in the UK. Fuel use in combined heat and power (CHP) plant has been modelled in terms of so-called `auto-generation'. Special care was taken not to `double count' auto-generation and grid decarbonisation; so that the relative contributions of each have been accounted for separately. Most of the electricity generated via steam boilers or CHP is used within the sector, with only a small amount exported. Currently-available technologies will lead to further, short-term energy and GHG emissions savings in paper mills, but the prospects for the commercial exploitation of innovative technologies by mid-21st century is speculative. The possible role of bioenergy as a fuel resource going forward has also been appraised. Finally, a set of low-carbon UK `technology roadmaps' for the paper sector out to 2050 have been developed and evaluated, based on various alternative scenarios. These yield transition pathways that represent forward projections which match short-term and long-term (2050) targets with specific technological solutions to help meet the key energy saving and decarbonisation goals. The content of these roadmaps were built up on the basis of the improvement potentials associated with different processes employed in the paper industry. Under a Reasonable Action scenario, the total GHG emissions from the sector are likely to fall over the period 1990--2050 by almost exactly an 80%; coincidentally matching GHG reduction targets established for the UK economy as a whole. However, the findings of this study indicate that the attainment of a significant decline in GHG emissions over the long-term will depends critically on the adoption of a small number of key technologies [e.g., energy efficiency and heat recovery techniques, bioenergy (with and without CHP), and the electrification of heat], alongside a decarbonisation of the electricity supply. The present roadmaps help identify the steps needed to be undertaken by developers, policy makers and other stakeholders in order to ensure the decarbonisation of the UK paper sector.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Effective management of natural resources is crucial for diminishing carbon emissions. This research explores how economic, financial, and political risks influence the relationship between natural resources rents and carbon emissions. Analyzing data from 66 countries, this study utilizes methods such as quantile regression and dynamic threshold regression to thoroughly assess the data. The findings reveal: (i) Natural resources rents tend to increase carbon emissions consistently across different quantiles (0.1 to 0.9). The fact is confirmed by robustness checks, illustrating that increased natural resources rents lead to higher emissions. (ii) Economic, financial, and political risks affect how natural resources rents impact carbon emissions. Notably, reduced economic and financial risks lessen the propensity of natural resources rents to boost emissions at higher quantiles, while a decline in political risk decreases the exacerbating effect of natural resources rents on emissions from the 0.1 to 0.9 quantiles. (iii) This analysis uncovers threshold effects where economic, financial, and political risks act as threshold factors. Specifically, when economic and political risks are low, a rise in natural resources rents actually leads to a decline in carbon emissions. The findings underscore the importance of considering these risks in the formulation of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions from natural resource exploitation.},

  abstract = {The combustion of fossil fuels is considered a major cause of climate change, which is why the reduction of emissions has become a key goal of the Paris climate agreement. Coherent monitoring of the energy profile of fishing vessels through an energy audit can effectively identify sources of inefficiency, allowing for the deployment of well-informed and cost-efficient remedial interventions. We applied energy audits to a test fleet of ten vessels, representing three typical Mediterranean trawl fisheries: midwater pair trawl, bottom otter trawl, and Rapido beam trawl. Overall, these fisheries use approximately 2.9\,litres of fuel per kilogram of landed fish, but the fuel consumption rate varies widely according to gear type and vessel size. This amount of fuel burned from capture to landing generates approximately 7.6\,kg{$\bullet$}CO2/kg fish on average. Minimising impacts and energy consumption throughout the product chain may be another essential element needed to reduce the environmental costs of fishing. Our results provided a set of recognised benchmarks that can be used for monitoring progress in this field.},

  abstract = {Food production is responsible for a quarter of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Marine fisheries are typically excluded from global assessments of GHGs or are generalized based on a limited number of case studies. Here we quantify fuel inputs and GHG emissions for the global fishing fleet from 1990--2011 and compare emissions from fisheries to those from agriculture and livestock production. We estimate that fisheries consumed 40 billion litres of fuel in 2011 and generated a total of 179 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent GHGs (4\% of global food production). Emissions from the global fishing industry grew by 28\% between 1990 and 2011, with little coinciding increase in production (average emissions per tonne landed grew by 21\%). Growth in emissions was driven primarily by increased harvests from fuel-intensive crustacean fisheries. The environmental benefit of low-carbon fisheries could be further realized if a greater proportion of landings were directed to human consumption rather than industrial uses.},

	abstract = {Urban form is closely related to CO2 emissions and the accurate estimation of the impact of urban form on CO2 emissions plays an important role in tackling climate change caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the effects of urban form on CO2 emission and its efficiency from three perspectives: urban expansion, compactness, and complexity. By using panel quantile regression with fixed effects, we show that: (1) The estimation results about the relationship between urban form and CO2 emission and its efficiency are consistent with the literature. (2) The partial effects of urban form without controlling for socioeconomic factors are heterogeneous throughout the conditional distribution of CO2 emission and its efficiency. (3) Taking into consideration that the partial effects of urban form on CO2 emission and its efficiency might depend on the magnitude of socioeconomic factors, we include interaction terms into our model and find that the interaction effects between socioeconomic factors and urban form are heterogeneous across cities with different levels of CO2 emission and its efficiency. Our empirical findings shed light on the optimization of urban form in improving the CO2 emission efficiency, providing policy makers with effective ways of reducing CO2 emissions across cities with different levels of CO2 emissions.},

@article{MetalsProduction,
	abstract = {Production of metals stands for 40{\%} of all industrial greenhouse gas emissions, 10% of the global energy consumption, 3.2 billion tonnes of minerals mined, and several billion tonnes of by-products every year. Therefore, metals must become more sustainable. A circular economy model does not work, because market demand exceeds the available scrap currently by about two-thirds. Even under optimal conditions, at least one-third of the metals will also in the future come from primary production, creating huge emissions. Although the influence of metals on global warming has been discussed with respect to mitigation strategies and socio-economic factors, the fundamental materials science to make the metallurgical sector more sustainable has been less addressed. This may be attributed to the fact that the field of sustainable metals describes a global challenge, but not yet a homogeneous research field. However, the sheer magnitude of this challenge and its huge environmental effects, caused by more than 2 billion tonnes of metals produced every year, make its sustainability an essential research topic not only from a technological point of view but also from a basic materials research perspective. Therefore, this paper aims to identify and discuss the most pressing scientific bottleneck questions and key mechanisms, considering metal synthesis from primary (minerals), secondary (scrap), and tertiary (re-mined) sources as well as the energy-intensive downstream processing. Focus is placed on materials science aspects, particularly on those that help reduce CO(2) emissions, and less on process engineering or economy. The paper does not describe the devastating influence of metal-related greenhouse gas emissions on climate, but scientific approaches how to solve this problem, through research that can render metallurgy fossil-free. The content is considering only direct measures to metallurgical sustainability (production) and not indirect measures that materials leverage through their properties (strength, weight, longevity, functionality).},

Rooted in the ``pollution paradise'' hypothesis, the ``pollution halo'' hypothesis, and the Porter hypothesis, this paper aims to verify the positive impact of foreign direct investment on low-carbon development in China's manufacturing sector and the positive moderating roles of environmental regulation and human capital in this process, while further analyzing the threshold characteristics of these moderating effects. Based on panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2003 to 2022 and using fixed effects and threshold effects models, this study finds that: First, foreign direct investment promotes low-carbon development in China's manufacturing sector, and so can environmental regulation and human capital. Second, as the intensity of environmental regulation intensifies, the promoting effect of foreign direct investment on lowcarbon development in China's manufacturing sector diminishes. Third, foreign direct investment significantly promotes low-carbon development in China's manufacturing sector only when the level of human capital reaches a certain threshold. In the context of global consensus on low-carbon development, this study provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing countries seeking to balance economic growth with low-carbon development.},

	abstract = {As part of its Paris Agreement commitment, China pledged to peak carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions around 2030, striving to peak earlier, and to increase the non-fossil share of primary energy to 20% by 2030. Yet by the end of 2017, China emitted 28% of the world's energy-related CO2 emissions, 76% of which were from coal use. How China can reinvent its energy economy cost-effectively while still achieving its commitments was the focus of a three-year joint research project completed in September 2016. Overall, this analysis found that if China follows a pathway in which it aggressively adopts all cost-effective energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction technologies while also aggressively moving away from fossil fuels to renewable and other non-fossil resources, it is possible to not only meet its Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments, but also to reduce its 2050 CO2 emissions to a level that is 42% below the country's 2010 CO2 emissions. While numerous barriers exist that will need to be addressed through effective policies and programs in order to realize these potential energy use and emissions reductions, there are also significant local environmental (e.g., air quality), national and global environmental (e.g., mitigation of climate change), human health, and other unquantified benefits that will be realized if this pathway is pursued in China.},

Given the violent contradiction between health and economy, this study focuses on the controversial relationship between inflation and important environmental indicators.                                         Methods:               Specifically, we collect monthly data on inflation and carbon returns from three representative pilots in China and make a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between carbon and inflation within the framework of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).                                         Results:               Some significant empirical results are found. First, inflation shows a linear impact on carbon returns, despite the signals of inflation vary in pilots. Second, there exists an inverted U-shape connection in Shenzhen and Guangdong pilots. Third, inflation appears to be a non-negligible factor in pilot fluctuations, despite differences exist among pilots.                                         Discussion:               Considering the pressing targets of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in China, this investigation provides important implications to policy makers in implementing differentiated policies across regions, particularly in the turbulent situations caused by frequent climate policy changes and global pandemic developments.},

  abstract = {As the top emitter of carbon dioxide worldwide, China faces a considerable challenge in reducing carbon emissions to combat global warming. Carbon emissions from coal consumption is the primary source of carbon dioxide emissions in China. The decomposition of the driving factors and the quantification of regions and industries needs further research. Thus, this paper decomposed five driving factors affecting carbon emissions from coal consumption in China, namely, carbon emission intensity, energy structure, energy intensity, economic output, and population scale, by constructing a Kaya-Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (Kaya-LMDI) decomposition model with data on coal consumption in China from 1997 to 2019. It was revealed that the economic output and energy intensity effects are major drivers and inhibitors of carbon emissions from coal consumption in China, respectively. The contribution and impact of these driving factors on carbon emissions from coal consumption were analyzed for different regions and industrial sectors. The results showed that carbon emissions from coal consumption increased by 3211.92 million tons from 1997 to 2019. From a regional perspective, Hebei Province has the most significant impact on carbon emissions from coal consumption due to the effect of economic output. Additionally, the industrial sector had the most pronounced influence on carbon emissions from coal consumption due to the economic output effect. Finally, a series of measures to reduce carbon emissions including controlling the total coal consumption, improving the utilization rate of clean energy, and optimizing the energy structure is proposed based on China's actual development.},

  abstract = {China's GDP grew 9\% annually during the end of the twentieth century. This economic growth degrades China's ecology, making it the world's greatest polluter. This position forced China to invest in developing nations and to take advantage of low-cost labor and increased pollution quotas from the World Trade Organization (WTO) to meet sustainable development objectives without environmental harm. The significance of this study is, first, this study examines the influence of Chinese outward foreign direct investment, gross domestic product, trade openness, technological innovation, and energy consumption on carbon emissions in Asian countries (Turkey, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, India, Indonesia, and Cambodia). Secondly, the panel autoregressive distributed lag cointegration (ARDL) technique was used on data from 2000 to 2020 to investigate the pollution halo/haven hypothesis and environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for south Asian nations. This analysis demonstrated that Chinese outbound foreign direct investment increases carbon emissions and confirms the pollution halo concept. Except for India and Pakistan, these nations show a U-shaped link between Chinese foreign direct investment and carbon emissions. So, policy implications recommended by the results of this study are foreign direct investment inflows with modern and ecofriendly technological transfer and enhancement in labor, and conservational management practices will benefit emerging countries to attain their sustainable development goals.},

This necessitates an understanding of host governments' expectations and the design of policies tailored to these needs. This study aims to address the gap in international business policy research by assessing FDI policy designs and identifying conditions that influence their effectiveness in attaining sustainable development outcomes. Building on a policy design fit model, we develop propositions related to the coherence of policy goals (goal coherence), the consistency of policy means (mean consistency), and the congruence between goals and means. Using crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis, we evaluate FDI policies in selected Sub-Saharan African countries. Contrary to conventional expectations, our findings reveal that while the combination of goal coherence, mean consistency, and congruence between goals and means is typically considered pertinent for policy design effectiveness, goal coherence alone is sufficient to attain FDI policy design effectiveness in the sampled countries. These results suggest that policymakers should prioritize clear, coherent goals in FDI policies to enhance sustainable development impact, potentially reducing the need for overly complex policy designs. This has implications for the formulation of future FDI strategies in similar contexts.},

While the MDGs focused on improving well-being in the developing world, the 17 SDGs address all countries and aim at reconciling economic and social with ecological goals. We adopt a social ecology perspective and critically reflect on the SDGs' potential for monitoring, supporting, and bringing about a transformation towards sustainability. Starting from a literature review on the SDGs, we link empirical findings from social ecology with analyses of SDG targets and indicators. First, we find that the SDGs fail to monitor absolute trends in resource use and thus prioritize economic growth over ecological integrity. Second, we discuss the contradictions between economic growth and sustainable resource use in early and late stages of industrialization processes and show that they are responsible for important trade-offs among SDG targets. Third, we analyze the transformative potential of the SDGs with a focus on the actors and institutions addressed to bring about transformative change. We find that the SDGs rely mainly on those institutions responsible for unsustainable resource use, and partly propose measures that even reinforce current trends towards less sustainability. Despite ascertaining limited transformative potential to the SDGs from an analytical perspective, we conclude by stressing the strategic relevance of the SDGs for visions, research, and practices of statt towards transformative change towards sustainability.},

The time period considered for the research spans from 2009 to 2019. Utilizing the CS-ARDL methodology, the results indicate a correlation between reducing ecological footprint and bolstering private sector domestic credit. Additionally, a relationship between diminishing pri\- vate sector domestic credit of banks and augmenting private sector domestic credit within the financial sector has been identified. In conjunction with other indicators of financial advance\- ment, the significance of domestic lending to the private sector has been underscored. The study reveals a notable reduction in human population's adverse impact on the environment. However, increased levels of energy consumption, foreign direct investment and per capita GDP are asso\- ciated with an improvement in global quality of life. Particularly noteworthy is the validation of the "pollution haven hypothesis" in the global economic context. The implications of this research are substantial; suggesting that global economic dynamics may support efforts towards envi\- ronmental conservation. However, outcomes may vary across regions or countries, particularly regarding the emphasis placed by the financial sector on environmental preservation. This study comprehensively examines the complex nexus between economic progress and its ecological consequences, keeping in consideration factors such as financial growth, urbanization, energy consumption and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the Environmental Kuznets curve based on quantile behavior of the relationship between economic growth, forest area, agriculture production, renewable energy, and environmental degradation. The current literature generally used a single indicator to address environmental issues; however single indicator neither measures overall environmental conditions nor does specify that the environment issue is generally diminishing. Our study is the first one that used ecological footprint (EF) as an indicator to test environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for Pakistan by employing recent approach of quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) initiated by Cho et al. (J Econ 188(1):281--300, 2015). The result of this study validates the EKC hypothesis for Pakistan and shows quantile-dependent relationship, and in that case, using the conventional methods may somewhat lead to biased results. Moreover, the rejection of the null hypothesis of parameter constancy is also confirmed by Wald test. In the long run, the findings of renewable energy consumption and forest area show significant negative effects on ecological footprints, which indicates that by increasing renewable energy usage and forest area, ecological footprints can be minimized. Interestingly, the short-term effects of agricultural production findings on EF show statistically negative results. This illustrates that EF can also be reduced in the agriculture sector by adopting environment-friendly technologies. In order to create efficient policies for environment deterioration, the empirical findings of the current analysis can be used as a guideline for policy implications.},

@article{sectoralEKCandpolicy,
	abstract = {<p>Since the contribution of economic sectors to GDP is heterogeneous, they also contribute differently to CO2 emissions and environmental degradation. In this regard, it is crucial to examine the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis at the sectoral level. Nevertheless, despite the extensive research conducted on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, significant gaps remain in the existing literature, particularly at the sectoral level. This study makes a novel contribution to the existing literature on the environmental EKC hypothesis by examining its validity across four distinct sectors: agriculture, industry, manufacturing, and services. Additionally, it makes a second contribution to the literature by examining the effect of energy consumption on CO2 asymmetrically, employing a novel panel non-linear ARDL (PNARDL) method. The study employs annual data from 38 OECD countries, spanning the period from 1990 to 2022. The findings demonstrate that the EKC hypothesis is valid for sectors other than the industrial sector and for the economy as a whole. The turning point of the Kuznets Curve for the total economy is estimated as $29250 GDP <italic>per capita</italic>. The PNARDL model's error correction term (ect) is negative and significant. However, the magnitude of the term suggests that the system will return to long-term equilibrium after approximately 2.87 years following any shock. Asymmetric effects are valid for four sectors. Moreover, the empirical results clearly show that energy consumption has asymmetric effects on emissions in both the long and short run. Positive and negative shocks in energy consumption increase CO2 emissions in OECD economies in the long run. It has been determined that agriculture is the sector that causes the most environmental degradation by increasing CO2 emissions. This situation highlights the limited availability of productive capital equipment and renewable sources in the agricultural sector, even in OECD countries. As a result, the findings show that there is a different relationship between each sector's GDP and CO2 emissions. It is important for policymakers to formulate sector-specific policies to reduce CO2 emissions while fostering GDP growth.</p>},

  abstract = {The topic of sustainable transportation has been debated among engineers and policymakers. On the one hand the transport sector plays a vital role in accelerating economic activities for economic development, but on the other hand it releases a vast amount of CO2, which adversely impacts the natural environment. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to determine the nexus among transport, economic growth and environmental degradation in the 10 Asian economies with highest CO2 emission from 1995 to 2017 by using multi-variate panel data analysis. This study includes the panel pool means group and auto-regressive distributed lag model to estimate the long-run relationship between variables. The result from the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) causality test manifests that there is a unidirectional connection between transport and economic growth. Moreover, the result findings observe a unidirectional causality between transport and environmental degra\- dation. Furthermore, the results manifest that there is an endogenous relationship between transport, economic growth and CO2 emission as well as environmental degradation is mainly influenced by the economic growth and transport sector. The empirical result from this study provided an overview of the attributes of CO2 emissions from the transport sector. The results not only help to advance the present literature but also can be of particular interest to policymakers.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the leading sector that is responsible for global climate change through its significant contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Intriguingly, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is experiencing higher temperatures and lesser rainfall due to climate change enhanced by anthropogenic GHG emissions. Agriculture and energy use in the SSA predominantly influence the anthropogenic GHG leading to global warming. Therefore, reducing agricultural GHG emissions (such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) plays a significant role in climate change adaptation. This paper reviews the potential implication of agriculture and energy use on climate change and its implications on environmental sustainability in SSA. Herewith, we explored various GHGs emitted through agriculture-energy use, their effects on climate change, as well as several climate change adaptation mechanisms, and gaps in existing knowledge that necessitate more research, were also explored. We found that agriculture had negative implications on climate change impacts in the SSA countries and that a more focused strategy that is both economically and technically feasible in terms of preferences for land use, effective energy use, and food supply would aid in GHG emission reduction and environmental sustainability. Adapting to the projected changes in the short term while investing in long-term mitigation strategies might be the only way toward a sustainable environment in this region.},

	abstract = {The broad scope and complexity of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) constitute a new challenge for policy. The identification of effective implementation strategies would need to be supported by coordinated policies that take into account the multiple relationships existing between the different dimensions of sustainability. 
		This report proposes an original method to identify and deal with inter-linkages. This method enables the identification of inter-linkages in a systemic way as a pivotal element of science supporting policy coherence for SDGs implementation and consistent with the key principles guiding the 2030 Agenda implementation in the international context.
		The proposed method consists of two tools adopting two different perspectives. The first tool is based on the review of the current literature on inter-linkages by identifying the main approaches and classifying the literature along them. This exercise allows the development of a first dashboard indicating the ``agreed'' inter-linkages from the literature. The second dashboard, developed starting from the existing European Union legislation, allows the identification of policy priority areas where the EU added value is maximized and where EU policy nodes can represent the levers to exploit synergies for the SDGs implementation. 
		The combination of the two dashboards provides an effective operational method to develop policy implementation strategies at Goal and target levels which can help improve the overall policy coherence for sustainable development.

Using advanced methodologies such as the panel autoregressive distributed lag model, augmented mean group, and the common correlated effects mean group, results of our study reveal that economic growth, energy intensity, and economic complexity positively and significantly affect environmental degradation, while green investment has negative and significant association with environmental degradation. Our findings further reveal that in the early stages of economic growth, increased GDP and energy intensity lead to increase carbon emissions. However, as economies grow further, green investment and advanced stages of growth help reduce carbon emissions, supporting the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Dumitrescu--Hurlin (D-H) causality results show unidirectional causalities, heading from economic growth, green investment, energy intensity and economic complexity toward environmental degradation. Bi-directional causality exists between economic growth and square of economic growth. These results have significant implications for policymakers, emphasizing the need for flexible and adaptive policies that consider the changing environmental impacts at different development stages. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of large-scale green investment initiatives as a strategic approach to mitigating the negative environmental effects of economic growth.},

By constructing a new comprehensive dataset of traded green products and drawing on economic complexity methods, we rank countries in terms of their ability to export complex green products competitively. We show that higher ranked countries are more likely to have higher environmental patenting rates, lower CO2 emissions, and more stringent environmental policies even after controlling for per capita GDP. We then examine countries’ potential to transition into green products in the future and find strong path dependence in the accumulation of green capabilities.

In long-run equilibrium, CO2 emissions appear to be energy consumption elastic and FDI inelastic, and the results seem to support the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The causality results indicate that there exists strong bidirectional causality between emissions and FDI and unidirectional strong causality running from output to FDI. The evidence seems to support the pollution haven and both the halo and scale effects. Therefore, in attracting FDI, developing countries should strictly examine the qualiﬁcations for foreign investment or to promote environmental protection through the coordinated know-how and technological transfer with foreign companies to avoid environmental damage. Additionally, there exists strong output-emissions and output-energy consumption bidirectional causality, while there is unidirectional strong causality running from energy consumption to emissions. Overall, the method of managing both energy demand and FDI and increasing both investment in the energy supply and energy efﬁciency to reduce CO2 emissions and without compromising the country’s competitiveness can be adopted by energy-dependent BRIC countries.},

The arguments of Pedroni and Kao cointegration tests were also used. According to these results, the variables used in this research are cointegrated in the long run. The results validated the arguments of the EKC hypothesis, i.e., the income per capita and squared income per capita are positively and negatively correlated with CO2 emissions. Moreover, economic complexity and renewable energy aim to improve environmental damage and climate change.},

The study highlights the role of various governance indicators in the formulation, implementation, and enforcement of environmental regulations. However, the study asserts that since in developing countries poverty, infrastructure, and human development are valued above a clean environment, good governance is less likely to contribute to mitigating pollution in developing countries. Using a panel of 160 countries, the study finds that better governance helps bring down the critical level of per capita income at which the relationship between income and pollution turns negative. Furthermore, the EKC can be shifted downward by improving governance in the respective countries. The study, however, reveals that the dividends of better governance are more pronounced at higher income levels. Since good governance works only when the desired regulations are in place, it is recommended that for poor countries aid packages for governance reforms need to emphasize the enactment of specific environmental regulations. Investment in institutions is expected to yield maximum dividends in such countries that have gained high-income status but are still lacking in institutional development.},

 abstract = {Some research has posited that while initially damaging to the environment, continued economic growth eventually leads to superior environmental quality. This relationship is often described as an 'Environmental Kuznets Curve' (EKC), after a similar hypothesis regarding income inequality made by economist Simon Kuznets. Following such findings, the EKC is sometimes offered as a rationale for encouraging economic growth as the best environmental policy option. This paper reconsiders the policy-relevance of the EKC idea, drawing on a wide range of international data collected in the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) project. Specifically, it tests the theoretical arguments advanced by Arrow and others (1995) that EKC relationships are unlikely to hold for environmental problems that are intergenerational in time or spread across national boundaries. The results of this research substantially confirm those arguments, providing more evidence that the EKC idea is an inadequate guide for environmental policy makers around the globe.},

This index aspires to mitigate data scarcity for cities and to provide policy makers with the tools for monitoring the evolving role of cities in the global economy. Analytically, we implement the economic complexity methodology on data for the ownership, location and economic activities of the world’s 3,000 largest firms and their subsidiaries to propose a new indicator that quantifies the network of the largest cities worldwide and the economic activities of their globalized firms. We first show that complex cities are the highly diversified cities that host non-ubiquitous economic activities of firms with global presence. Then, in a sample of EU cities, we show that complex cities tend to be more prosperous, have higher population, and are associated with more jobs, human capital, innovation, technology and transport infrastructure. Last, using OLS methodology and accounting for several other confounders, we show that a higher ECI, at the city level, enhances the resilience of cities to negative economic shocks, i.e., their ability to bounce back after a shock. Specifically, we find that the expected increase of the ratio of employment in 2012 over 2006 is 0.01 (mean: 0.992; standard deviation: 0.081) when the ECI increases by 1 unit (mean: 0.371; standard deviation: 1.094), i.e., a satisfactory pace of recovery, in terms of employment. The ability to diversify in the presence of a shock, the reallocation of factors of production to other sectors and the ability to extract rents associated with those diversified activities, uncovers the mechanics of the ECI index.},

We establish dynamic panel models that incorporate lagged-dependent variables and employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for estimation. Our pooled-sample regression results show that the enhancement of overall financial openness could increase the economic complexity significantly, as well as de-facto and de-jure openness. The subsample regressions indicate heterogeneous impacts of financial openness depending on country groups and industry. Besides, there exists significant path dependence for ECI improvement, which is more prominent in high-income countries. For low- and middle-income countries, greater GVC participation and lower banking concentration can promote ECI improvement significantly.},

Interpreting the Balassa index is difficult, however, in view of the limited knowledge to date on the distribution of this index. We analyze theempirical distribution of the Balassa index and its stability and properties over time, using Japan-European Union trade data. It appears that the distribution is relatively stable over time and that the widely used rule that ``a Balassa index above one'' identifies a strong sector, selects about one-third of all industries. On the other hand, the distribution appears to differ markedly across countries.},

	abstract = {The Balassa Index (BI) is a widely used index for evaluating a country's trade (dis) advantage or specialization. Unsatisfied with its unstable distribution and poor ordinal ranking property, which arise from its unstable mean, asymmetric distributional shape, skewness and variable upper bound, many alternatives of BI, including Logarithm of RCA (LRCA), Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA), Additive RCA (ARCA), Weighted RCA (WRCA), Normalized RCA (NRCA), B∗, and RCAi,k based on a micro-founded Ricardian model, have been proposed in the past several decades. One guiding principle in constructing new indices is that the distribution follows as much as possible a Gaussian. However, this goal has never been satisfactorily realized. To understand the cause, we have systematically carried out empirical analysis of exports within and across countries. We find that the exports of all the goods of a country, as well as a fixed good exported by all the countries in the world follow exponentially truncated Zipf-Mandelbrot's law, after ranked in descending order. The BI amounts to be the ratio of two such distributions, one in the naturally descending order of the exponentially truncated Zipf-Mandelbrot' law, the other being a permutation of the Zipf-Mandelbrot's law with truncation (possibly with different parameters). Only in very rare situations can these ratios follow a Gaussian distribution. We thus shed light on why BI and its alternatives may have unstable mean for different goods or countries, asymmetric distributional shape, skewness and variable upper bound. In particular, the last feature is a natural consequence of the log-normal distribution of BI, which we find to likely occur in certain situations.},

The data are organized by the 4-digit Standard International Trade Classification, revision 2, with country codes similar to the United Nations classification. This dataset updates the Statistics Canada World Trade Database as described in Feenstra, Lipsey, and Bowen (1997), which was available for years 1970-1992. In that database, Statistics Canada had revised the United Nations trade data, mostly derived from the export side, to fit the Canadian trade classification and in some cases to add data not available from the export reports. In contrast, in the new NBER-UN dataset we give primacy to the trade flows reported by the importing country, whenever they are available, assuming that these are more accurate than reports by the exporters. If the importer report is not available for a country-pair, however, then the corresponding exporter report is used instead. Corrections and additions are made to the United Nations data for trade flows to and from the United States, exports from Hong Kong and China, and imports into many other countries.},

Changes in the world's human dynamics are crucial for understanding the current state of the world, which is faced with increasing challenges related to globalization. In this paper, we propose to analyze the shifting locations of centers of gravity of four basic global indicators (these are Gross Domestic Product, carbon dioxide emissions, population, and urban population) for the period 1960e2016. The spatial locations of the respective centers of gravity (one per year) draw some traces that explain, at least partially, relevant changes on different world's human dynamics at a global level. These traces and dynamics are further discussed. In addition, these traces are fundamental for predicting upcoming trends for the next few years. Results shown here may help political leaders and policymakers for solving upcoming and future global challenges related to the current economic system and its impact on the environment.},

@article{KOFGlobalisationIndex,
	abstract = {We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091--1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091--1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others. The KOF Globalisation Index can be downloaded from http://www.kof.ethz.ch/globalisation/.},

A firm's ability to identify the production and export of marine-related products can be viewed as an essential part of a long-term strategy aimed at supporting marine economic development. We identify a list of marine-related products that have the greatest growth potential for 107 Chinese firms and their related industries and draw a conceptual model of marine-related products at the country and firm levels using the concepts of product space and product proximity, which provides a new policy analysis tool for sustainable marine development. To achieve our goals, we conduct a regression analysis of this hypothesis. We build an improved product space for China and the 107 firms in 2011 and 2012 and calculate the maximum proximity of each marine-related product to products with high revealed comparative advantage (RCA) values for each firm. The results show that the marine-related products with the greatest proximity to the products with high RCA values exhibited the greatest growth. Finally, we also provide new applications for the development of marine-related products as a complementary policy analysis tool for China's marine economic development.},

We test this hypothesis performing a regression analysis. We build the product space for 141 different countries for the years between 2005 and 2013 and for each country we compute the maximum proximity of each green product to the products with high RCA (i.e., the proximity of the product source of competitive advantage closest to the green product considered). Results confirm that green products with high maximum proximity to the products with high RCA had the highest growth. So doing, we contribute to the literature by providing a new application of the product space as a policy making tool for green development. We also provide several applications of the proposed method.},

Building on the product space model initially advanced by Hidalgo et al. in 2007, this article proposes a green product space methodology to map the export strengths of countries for a specified set of green products. The methodology does so by identifying green products for which a country is likely to be competitive in the world market based on export performance of related products. Results for Brazil are presented to illustrate the green product space methodology followed by a discussion of its limitations and potential contribution to industrial policy formulation to support emerging green sectors.},

	abstract = {We test if and where industrial policy to promote ‘green’ industry development can improve competitiveness in export markets. Proponents of ‘green growth’ have argued that domestic promotion of ‘green’ energy will generate improved comparative advantage in export markets for high-technology goods such as wind turbines or solar cells. If this holds depends on if domestic market expansion can, on its own, support firm competitiveness abroad. We find evidence that industrial policy may work for wind turbines, but we find no evidence that it works for solar cells. Furthermore, domestic renewable energy promotion is more likely to translate into improved international competitiveness if a country already possesses skills, technologies, and industrial sectors closely related to the sector in question. By locating the wind turbine and solar cell sectors in the global product space of traded goods, we are able to show that, net of historical competitiveness and domestic market size, green industrial policy functions best when capitalising on pre-existing industrial capacities, rather than trying to create them. Finally, our finding that policy appears to work for wind turbines but not solar cells may reflect the greater tradeability of solar cells, which may mean that expansion of domestic demand leads to more imports rather than expanded domestic production. While this paper suggests conditions under which green industrial policy might prove effective in economic development, it makes no claims about whether this represents an efficient approach to either growth or emissions reduction. This evidence recommends caution in using economic growth and competitiveness arguments as the primary justification for investments in renewable energy.},

Rates of labor (in)formality, however, vary widely within countries. This paper presents a new stylized fact, namely the systematic positive relationship between the rate of labor formality and the working age population in cities. We hypothesize that this phenomenon occurs through the emergence of complex economic activities: as cities become larger, labor is allocated into increasingly complex industries as firms combine complementary capabilities derived from a more diverse pool of workers. Using data from Colombia, we use a network-based model to show that the technological proximity (derived from worker transitions between industry pairs) of current industries in a city to potential new complex industries governs the growth of the formal sector in the city. The mechanism proposed has robust strong predictive power, and fares better than alternative explanations of (in)formality.},

	abstract = {The relationship between natural resources and the ecological footprint has critical environmental implications. However, as critical as it is, this domain is insufficiently examined by researchers, and shows ambiguous results. Moreover, these studies do not address the role of technological innovation in shaping the ecological footprint, in an open and explicit manner. Therefore, realizing the need for a more critical evaluation of the intricacies involved in studying the ecological footprint, this study analyzes the linkages between natural resources, technological innovations, economic growth, and the resulting ecological footprint in emerging economies. Drawing on the data from 1984 to 2016, we employed the second-generation panel cointegration methodologies to study the findings of this research. Results of Pesaran's CD test and P\&Y's slope homogeneity test confirm the existence of a slope heterogeneity across countries, and correlation amongst cross-sectional units. Moreover, Cointegration results confirm a stable, long-run relationship between the ecological footprint, natural resources, technological innovations, and economic growth. In the long run, natural resources and economic growth increase and expand the ecological footprint, while technological innovations are helpful in abating environmental degradation that takes place a result of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the quadric term for economic growth showed a negative impact on the ecological footprint, i.e., in the presence of the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, the results from CS-ARDL were reconfirmed by utilizing the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method. Also, the result of the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality test shows that any policy to target natural resources, technological innovations, and economic growth significantly alters the ecological footprint and vice versa. Our key findings lead towards the manifestation and emphasis of the importance of appropriate policies for restoring natural resources and at the same time, upgrading technological innovations in order to attain sustainable development goals.},

Although the existing literature is evident on the factors influencing resource consumption, the role of economic complexity and trade openness is underexplored. Therefore, the study anticipates the short and long-run impact of trade openness, economic complexity, economic growth, and globalization in newly industrialized countries (NICs) from 1990 to 2019. The study utilized the Cross-section Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) model to overcome the concerns of cross-section dependence and slope heterogeneity along with the Augmented Mean Group estimates to vali­ date the outcomes. The results reveal that trade openness, globalization, and economic growth are negative, while economic complexity positively affects the material footprints in the NICs. The moderation effect of trade openness and economic complexity significantly affects resource consumption in the long run, whereas its effect is negligible in the short run. These findings signify that trade in industrialized countries is responsible for the excessive usage of materials in the region; however, resource depletion is meticulous if industrial processes are augmented with complex products. The findings imply that economic complexity neutralizes the negative con­ sequences of globalization and revising the trade policies in the newly industrialized region could help to reduce resources consumption.},

This impact has not been comprehensively explored for the case of Mexico using the newly developed dual adjustment approach. The fundamental innovation of the approach is that it offers an alternative to cointegration analysis, which reduces the implicit assumption of the singular adjustment in cointegration analysis. Furthermore, the study employs an autoregressive distributed lag approach to capture both the long-run and short-run association, while frequency domain causality tests are applied to capture causal linkages among the variables in the short run, medium run and long run. The empirical findings of this study reveal that: (a) globalization and financial development improve the quality of the environment; (b) energy consumption and economic growth deteriorate environmental quality; (c) trade openness exerts no significant impact on environmental quality. The findings from the frequency domain causality test reveal that financial development, energy usage, and economic growth can predict consumption-based carbon emissions at different frequencies, whereas trade openness and globalization can predict significant variations in consumption-based carbon emissions in the long and short term. Based on the empirical findings, the study suggests that the government of Mexico should be careful when formulating policies aimed at increasing growth, as they could be detrimental to the quality of the environment.},

            Energy is pivotal for sustainable economic growth. Undoubtedly, the role of the composition of the export basket (measured as economic complexity) is one of the crucial variables influencing energy consumption. Despite its importance, the existing body of literature does not intensively study the relationship between economic complexity and total energy consumption. Therefore, this study's primary aim was to examine the effect of economic complexity on energy consumption in a case study of 21 developed and 44 developing countries for the period 1971–2014. In this context, economic complexity expresses the level of sophistication of a country's export basket. This paper considers energy prices and income as explanatory variables in Durbin‐H panel cointegration analysis and applies a cointegration test with structural breaks to check for the long‐run relationships. For the long‐run estimations, we employ the augmented mean group method and dynamic seemingly unrelated regression. The findings reveal that economic complexity increases energy consumption in developing countries while it decreases energy consumption in developed countries. This is an important insight for countries concerned about their energy dependence. The diversification of their production and export baskets can reduce energy needs. The paper finally presents policy recommendations based on the empirical estimates.},

We show that moving to higher levels of economic complexity leads to better overall environmental performance, which means that sophistication of exported products does not induce environmental degradation. Nevertheless, we find that the effect of economic complexity on air quality is negative, i.e., exposure to PM2.5, CO\$\$\_2\$\$, methane and nitrous oxide emissions increases, and these findings are robust across alternative econometric specifications.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes simple tests of error cross-sectional dependence which are applicable to a variety of panel data models, including stationary and unit root dynamic heterogeneous panels with short T and large N. The proposed tests are based on the average of pair-wise correlation coefficients of the OLS residuals from the individual regressions in the panel and can be used to test for cross-sectional dependence of any fixed order p, as well as the case where no a priori ordering of the cross-sectional units is assumed, referred to as \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{CD\}(p)\$\$and \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{CD\}\$\$tests, respectively. Asymptotic distribution of these tests is derived and their power function analyzed under different alternatives. It is shown that these tests are correctly centred for fixed N and T and are robust to single or multiple breaks in the slope coefficients and/or error variances. The small sample properties of the tests are investigated and compared to the Lagrange multiplier test of Breusch and Pagan using Monte Carlo experiments. It is shown that the tests have the correct size in very small samples and satisfactory power, and, as predicted by the theory, they are quite robust to the presence of unit roots and structural breaks. The use of the \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{CD\}\$\$test is illustrated by applying it to study the degree of dependence in per capita output innovations across countries within a given region and across countries in different regions. The results show significant evidence of cross-dependence in output innovations across many countries and regions in the World.},

Our study utilizes the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to estimate our dynamic models covering 34 OECD countries and 24 non-OECD countries from 1995 to 2015. The empirical results show a heterogeneous impact of economic complexity on embodied carbon emissions in exports (EEE) and imports (EEI). Besides, the scale effect, composition effect, and technology effect are also significant drivers of embodied carbon emissions. The improvement of economic complexity can decrease the marginal effects of export scale and export structure on foreign EEE (but not domestic EEE) significantly, while the marginal positive impacts of technology on EEE can be further enhanced by economic complexity growth. Moreover, there is no strong evidence to prove the significant indirect impacts of economic complexity on foreign carbon emission embodied in imports, while economic complexity has significantly positive indirect impacts on domestic carbon emission embodied in imports only through import scale. In the subsample regressions, we found asymmetric impacts of economic complexity between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries.},

By estimating an ECM version of the novel CS-ARDL model, we find robust evidence of both short-run and long-run adverse effects of aggregate government expenditure on private investments. Increases in productive expenditure have no significant effect on the long-run dynamics of private investments, whereas reallocating public resources towards productive expenditure enhances them. By contrast, both level increases and shifts of resources towards unproductive expenditure discourage capital formation in the private sector. Using the government budget constraint (GBC) system, we observe that the effects of government expenditure depend on how it is financed. In most cases, the short-run fall in private investments is mainly associated with tax-financed expenditure, while debt-financed expenditure appears to be the most detrimental in the long-run.},

	abstract = {Amid rising socio-economic and environmental concerns across countries, it is imperative to keep on evolving and regularly adapting innovation and latest technologies. In the same pursuits, economic complexity demonstrates the sophistication of technology which is highly associated with environmental quality and renewable energy transition. Therefore, the present study is intended to explore the roles of economic complexity and renewable energy in pollution alleviation and precisely in alleviating carbon emissions in the BRICS countries. In doing so, this study applied novel Method of Moments Quantile regression using annual data from 1995 to 2018. The overall results produce emissions mitigating effects of economic complexity and renewable energy mainly at higher emissions quantiles. The interaction of both variables suggests that economic complexity leads to renewable energy transition, which reduce carbon emissions more pronouncedly. These results suggest that there is a need to strategize the pathway for the potential investments to be made in the sector of renewable energy along with the areas of technology, innovation, human resource development and R\&D which eventually improve economic complexity and environmental sustainability.},

	abstract = {The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it provides evidence that economic complexity contributes to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity as well as per capita emissions. It is argued that the production of complex goods is associated with lower emission intensity due to the types of technologies used in the production of such goods and their high value-added characteristic. Using data for 67 countries between 1976 and 2012, the tests reported in the paper suggest that an increase of 0.1 in the economic complexity index generates a 2\% decrease in next period’s emissions of kilotons of CO2e per billion dollars of output as well as in emissions per capita. Second, the paper proposes a Product Emission Intensity Index (PEII) associated with the production of 786 goods. The index is a weighted average of the emissions of the countries that export each given product with revealed comparative advantage. This index makes it possible to analyse specifically what products are associated with higher emission intensities, contributing to the formulation of policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shifting production away from high-emission intensity products as much as possible. The index corroborates that complex products are associated with lower emission intensities.},

It resides on the premise of hidden capabilities—fundamental endowments underlying the productive structure. In general, measuring the capabilities behind economic complexity directly is difficult, and indirect measures have been suggested which exploit the fact that the presence of the capabilities is expressed in a country’s mix of products. We complement these studies by introducing a probabilistic framework which leverages Bayesian non-parametric techniques to extract the dominant features behind the comparative advantage in exported products. Based on economic evidence and trade data, we place a restricted Indian Buffet Process on the distribution of countries’ capability endowment, appealing to a culinary metaphor to model the process of capability acquisition. The approach comes with a unique level of interpretability, as it produces a concise and economically plausible description of the instantiated capabilities.},

Many of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries and Turkey show relatively low economic complexity with undiversified product spaces. The present study is thereby motivated to investigate the economic complexity-environmental quality relation for the MENA countries and Turkey. Using panel data for eighteen MENA countries and Turkey over the period 1990–2020, the fully modified ordinary least squares method of estimation is employed in two separate models, and Granger causality tests are performed. Each model includes the relation of economic complexity to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, one form of energy (renewable or non-renewable), population density and variables to validate the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. In model (1), a negative and statistically significant renewable energy consumption has a mitigating effect on CO2 emissions, though economic complexity and its interaction with renewable energy consumption are not statistically significant. In model (2), a positive and statistically significant non-renewable energy indicates that increased fossil fuel reliance increases CO2 emissions (deteriorating environmental quality), while a negative and statistically significant economic complexity and population density reduce CO2 emissions (improving environmental quality), respectively. The EKC hypothesis is validated for the MENA countries and Turkey in both models (1) and (2), and Granger causality test results are given. Among the key policy implications are that the MENA countries and Turkey must recognize that increasing GDP and industrialization must be coupled with moving from less- to more-knowledge-based structures.},

The countries considered fall into three different income groups, namely high income, higher middle income, and lower middle income. The study employs the panel quantile regression methodology and tests the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by including economic complexity and other control variables such as energy consumption, urbanization, and trade openness in its model. The results show that economic complexity has significant impacts on the environment. Based on the analysis, economic complexity has increased the environmental degradation in lower and higher middle-income countries, and has controlled CO2 emissions in high-income countries. Since economic complexity plays a significant role in environmental damage, it is crucial for low- and middle-income countries to adjust their current industrial and production policies to promote economic growth and at the same time protect the environment.},

	abstract = {The discussion concerning whether and how economic complexity (ECI) affects ecological footprint (EFP) has gained researchers’ consideration, while there are slight empirical evidence to support the subject matter. In the support of theoretical argument, this study provides empirical evidence by investigating the impact of ECI on EFP along with the role of disaggregated energy consumptions by using a panel dataset of G-7 economies between 1996 and 2019. To this end, we applied panel techniques of Fully-Modify OLS and Dynamic-OLS models for cointegration analysis. The results obtained from Fully-Modify OLS and Dynamic-OLS models reveal that ECI deteriorates environmental quality by increasing EFP, while renewable energy reduces ecological pollution by decreasing EFP. In addition, the increasing demand for non-renewable energy and economic growth both degrades environmental quality in G-7 countries. More interestingly, the non-linear (ECI2) relationship between ECI and EFP confirms a U-shaped association (EKC hypothesis), which suggests that after achieving a certain threshold level, economic complexity mitigates environmental degradation in G-7 economies. The empirical results also suggest that other control variables such as population growth, inflation rate, foreign direct investment, and total trade intensity lead to environmental degradation by increasing ecological footprint. Based on empirical results, the following important policy implications are drawn; first, G-7 economies should speed up the level of economic complexity along with renewable energy consumption to protect environmental quality and maintain sustainable growth and development. Secondly, the governments of G-7 countries should introduce greener technologies and promote production that are environmental friendly for drastic reduction in environmental unsustainability.},

For a more specific case, economic complexity does not support energy efficiency in all economic groups, although the situation improves for countries with an existing higher energy intensity in the advanced and emerging economies. Also, it adversely affects renewable energy consumption and renewable electricity output in all economic groups, except in a few quantiles where insignificance or heterogeneous outcomes are established. In sum, economic complexity cannot be said to aid the efficiency of the energy system and the transition to renewable energy owing to a number of identified factors. Subsidizing renewable energy consumption, provision of grants for renewable energy deployment, and setting energy efficiency standards are among the strategic policy derivatives of the findings of this study.},

	abstract = {Today, many countries in the world pay special attention to energy efficiency to improve environmental quality and reduce the waste of energy resources. For this purpose, this research has investigated the economic complexity of energy intensity (EI) from 1995 to 2019 using club convergence and panel quantile regression (PQR) models. The club convergence results showed that out of 62 countries, 42 converged in energy intensity during the period. Then, using the PQR model, the determining factors of EI for these 42 countries were evaluated: economic complexity, urbanization, trade openness, industrial production, foreign direct investment, oil price, and economic growth. The result of the PQR model confirmed that economic complexity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with EI. Urbanization and foreign direct investment have a positive and increasing effect on EI. In addition, trade openness positively affects EI, mainly in the 10th and 25th quantiles. On the other hand, economic growth has a decreasing effect on EI. Moreover, industrialization and oil prices can reduce EI, particularly in the 90th quantile. Given the inverted U-shaped effect of the energy complexity on energy intensity, where the lower and higher quantiles are negative, it is advised that policymakers ought to promote the leap from lower levels of economic complexity to higher levels by reducing intermediate levels as much as possible. Policymakers should also be conscious that promoting the diffusion of economic complexity also mitigates noxious gas emissions.},

A stochastic convergence methodology was used, and the contrasts of the hypothesis were carried out through standard unit root tests and with structural break. The results show that the dispersion of complexity between countries increased steadily. In addition, these do not reveal absolute  convergence, except for Costa Rica and Mexico, while other countries share common trends or present  divergence compared to the reference countries. These findings imply that some economic problems, such as slow growth or levels of economic development, could not be solved if the systemic interactions at the productive level, revealed in the degree of economic complexity, do not improve. One of the limitations of the study is that it does not explicitly contemplate the relationship with other dimensions of sustainable development.},

Although between the 1980s and 1990s, the sophistication of exportable products increased by 13\%, it is evident to see the low progress of the Latin American region to consolidate the change in its productivity and its dependence on oil extraction activities, minerals, and other raw materials. This article evaluates and quantifies the impact of human capital, globalization, and the role of the efficiency of institutions in the sophistication of production in Latin America compared to economies with greater complexity. This is conducted using panel data methodology with cointegration techniques, using data from 17 countries that belong to the continental part of Latin America and 10 countries with the greatest economic complexity according to the Atlas of Economic Complexity Index. These countries are classified by their income level, data compiled by the United Nations Development Program Indicators, the Harvard Growth Lab Atlas of Economic Complexity, the Swiss Economic Institute database, and the Heritage Foundation. The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between the explanatory variables and economic complexity. However, the nature of the relationships differs between the different income levels, finding the same trend in the cointegration analyses. It requires the adoption of public policies in the curricular and evaluative field of knowledge and skills as well as the fight against corruption in public and private sectors, motivating the improvement of bilateral relations with other countries in an economic, political, and social way.},

	abstract = {This research evaluates how energy (geothermal and coal), economic complexity, and technological innovation impact the ecological footprint in newly industrialized countries (NICs), considering the period 1990–2018. The authors employed economic complexity, technological innovation, and ecological footprint as significant considerations instead of standard environmental and economic parameters. The study used cross-sectional augmented distributed lag (CS-ARDL) and the pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin (DH) panel causality to consider the dynamic character of the correlation between the Environment and economic activities. The outcomes of the CS-ARDL showed that economic growth and coal energy intensify ecological footprint in both the long and short run. However, CS-ARDL results revealed that geothermal energy consumption, economic complexity, and technological innovation lessen the ecological footprint in NICs in the long and short run. Finally, the DH causality results revealed a unidirectional causality from geothermal, technological innovation, economic complexity, and coal energy use to ecological footprint. This demonstrates that all the exogenous variables have a predicted power on the ecological footprints in NICs. Based on these findings, policy measures to diversify products have the potential to tackle ecological problems.},

	abstract = {At present, the main focus of research lies in examining the connection between economic complexity and carbon emissions as a whole, but there is a scarcity of quantitative investigations on the link between the above variables within specific industries. Therefore, this study introduces economic complexity as a new variable to build a panel model within the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Based on the data of the countries along the Belt and Road from 1998 to 2018, we used the Granger causality test to examine the causal relationship between variables, and use the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square methods to estimate the coefficients of variables. The key factor linking economic complexity and carbon emissions in the logistics industry is technology innovation Economic complexity can explain and predict the changes in carbon emissions of logistics industry more reasonably, and the relationship between them in line with the environmental kuznets curve hypothesis. Only high-income countries can increase economic complexity while reducing carbon emissions of logistics industry. Based on the empirical analysis, it is suggested that upper-middle income and lower middle-income countries can formulate relevant policies and regulations, and high-income countries can improve the relevant policies and regulations to promote the reduction of carbon emissions of the logistics industry. Studying the impact of economic complexity on carbon emissions in the logistics industry can help better predict and respond to the impact of climate change on the logistics industry.},

Here we conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis on anxiety disorders by including 74,973 (28,392 proxy) cases and 400,243 (146,771 proxy) controls. We identified 14 risk loci, including 10 new associations near CNTNAP5, MAP2, RAB9BP1, BTN1A1, PRR16, PCLO, PTPRD, FARP1, CDH2 and RAB27B. Functional genomics and fine-mapping pinpointed the potential causal variants, and expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed the potential target genes regulated by the risk variants. Integrative analyses, including transcriptome-wide association study, proteome-wide association study and colocalization analyses, prioritized potential causal genes (including CTNND1 and RAB27B). Evidence from multiple analyses revealed possibly causal genes, including RAB27B, BTN3A2, PCLO and CTNND1. Finally, we showed that Ctnnd1 knockdown affected dendritic spine density and resulted in anxiety-like behaviours in mice, revealing the potential role of CTNND1 in anxiety disorders. Our study identified new risk loci, potential causal variants and genes for anxiety disorders, providing insights into the genetic architecture of anxiety disorders and potential therapeutic targets.},

Here we report the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/uptake and determinants among this vulnerable population of PLHIV based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published by 25 August 2023. Among the 54 included studies (N = 167,485 participants), 53 (N = 166,455) provided data on vaccine acceptance rate, while 27 (N = 150,926) provided uptake data. The global prevalences of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake were 67.0\% and 56.6\%, respectively. Acceptance and uptake rates were 86.6\% and 90.1\% for the European Region, 74.9\% and 71.6\% for the Region of the Americas, 62.3\% and 78.9\% for the South-East Asian Region, 64.6\% and 19.3\% for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 58.0\% and 35.5\% for the African Region, and 57.4\% and 44.0\% for the Western Pacific Region. The acceptance rate increased from 65.9\% in 2020 to 71.0\% in 2022, and the uptake rate increased from 55.9\% in 2021 to 58.1\% in 2022. Men, PLHIV aged ≥40 years and those who had recently received the influenza vaccine were more likely to accept and receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with lower uptake included Black race, other races (Latinx/Hispanic/mixed race), low education level and being unemployed. Vaccine-related factors associated with higher acceptance included belief in vaccine effectiveness, vaccine trust, perceived high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and fear of potential COVID-19 effect in PLHIV. Sustained efforts and targeted interventions are needed to reduce regional disparities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PLHIV.},

Here we synthesize 443 studies and apply multilevel mixed-effects metaregression analyses to compare the responses of 187 non-native and 1,852 native animal species across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems to different types of EWE. Our results show that marine animals, regardless of whether they are non-native or native, are overall insensitive to EWEs, except for negative effects of heatwaves on native mollusks, corals and anemone. By contrast, terrestrial and freshwater non-native animals are only adversely affected by heatwaves and storms, respectively, whereas native animals negatively respond to heatwaves, cold spells and droughts in terrestrial ecosystems and are vulnerable to most EWEs except cold spells in freshwater ecosystems. On average, non-native animals displayed low abundance in terrestrial ecosystems, and decreased body condition and life history traits in freshwater ecosystems, whereas native animals displayed declines in body condition, life history traits, abundance, distribution and recovery in terrestrial ecosystems, and community structure in freshwater ecosystems. By identifying areas with high overlap between EWEs and EWE-tolerant non-native species, we also provide locations where native biodiversity might be adversely affected by their joint effects and where EWEs might facilitate the establishment and/or spread of non-native species under continuing global change.},

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

	abstract = {The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb – most commonly the rule of 10 – associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},

	abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression‐type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold‐based pre‐selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor‐response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine‐learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold‐based pre‐selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold‐based pre‐selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘folk lore’‐thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre‐analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

@article{MiningSector,
	abstract = {The continuation and increasing importance of mining is inevitable as society embraces both the transition to a low-carbon economy and application of circular economy concepts. However, across many parts of society, there is an ongoing sense that those who are carrying many of the costs and risks related to mining particularly over the long term (often host communities and countries) are not seeing a level of benefit that seems fair. In contrast, there is frustration within the industry that mining is not being given due credit for the importance of its role in contemporary society by those who would criticize industry practices. Over the past several decades, dozens of initiatives aimed at strengthening mining's social and environmental performance have been mounted from both within and outside the industry. These generally depend on a ``leadership-trickle-down''change model. While progress has been achieved, the society-industry trust deficit continues. The global mining community comprises a corporate core and a complex range of other surrounding interests. We suggest that some key questions regarding the nature of this community and its appetite and capacity for change have not been explored thus impeding the effectiveness of change management. We offer (1) an estimate of the number of companies that lie at the core of the global mining community: some 25,000 operating in about 140 countries (using data from the mid-2010s); (2) a profile of these companies as an initial step towards understanding the ``culture''of the global mining community; and (3) a listing of additional complexities and observations important to bringing global-wide improvement to mining's social and environmental performance. We argue that building on work to date, a fresh approach is required. We are calling for a dialog to reflect on the ideas presented here, refine them as appropriate, and develop the needed strategies and action plans. Such a process must build from a comprehensive understanding of the global mining community and its culture. It must be collaborative in nature and involve not only the range of mining companies but also with surrounding interests and governments. If this is not done, the change that is needed to align actions of all mining actors with social values will not occur and the trust deficit will remain.},

We show that the ECI and PCI are equivalent to a spectral clustering algorithm that partitions a similarity graph into two parts. The measures are also closely related to various dimensionality reduction methods, such as diffusion maps and correspondence analysis. Our results shed new light on the ECI’s empirical success in explaining cross-country differences in gross domestic product per capita and economic growth, which is often linked to the diversity of country export baskets. In fact, countries with high (low) ECI tend to specialize in high-PCI (low-PCI) products. We also find that the ECI and PCI uncover specialization patterns across U.S. states and U.K. regions.},

	abstract = {The idea that skills, technology, and knowledge, are spatially concentrated, has a long academic tradition. Yet, only recently this hypothesis has been empirically formalized and corroborated at multiple spatial scales, for different economic activities, and for a diversity of institutional regimes. The new synthesis is an empirical principle describing the probability that a region enters---or exits---an economic activity as a function of the number of related activities present in that location. In this paper we summarize some of the recent empirical evidence that has generalized the principle of relatedness to a fact describing the entry and exit of products, industries, occupations, and technologies, at the national, regional, and metropolitan scales. We conclude by describing some of the policy implications and future avenues of research implied by this robust empirical principle.},

We also apply this model in order to implement three regional sub-groups; European and North Asian region, Latin American and Caribbean region, and the Middle Eastern, North African and sub-Saharan region. The results revealed that the energy use has a positive impact on the carbon dioxide emissions for all the panels. The impact of economic growth on the environment has received increased attention as global warming and other environmental problems become more serious. Indeed, the per capita GDP has a positive and statistically significant impact on carbon for the global panel, for the Europe and North Asia, and for the Middle Eastern, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, our empirical results indicate the presence of an inverted U-shaped curve between carbon dioxide emissions and GDP per capita.},

We propose that new inventions reshape networks of interlinked technologies by shifting inventors’ attention to or away from the knowledge on which those inventions build. Using this approach, we develop novel indexes of the extent to which a new invention consolidates or destabilizes existing technology streams. We apply these indexes in analyses of university research commercialization and ﬁnd that, although federal research funding pushes campuses to create inventions that are more destabilizing, deeper commercial ties lead them to produce technologies that consolidate the status quo. By quantifying the eﬀects that new technologies have on their predecessors, the indexes we propose allow patent-based studies of innovation to capture conceptually important phenomena that are not detectable with established measures. The measurement approach presented here oﬀers empirical insights that support theoretical development in studies of innovation, entrepreneurship, technology strategy, science policy, and social network theory.},

Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—the CD index12—that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13–17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

We discover a steady leading-following relationship in research topics between Western nations or Asian city-states and others. Furthermore, we find that a nation’s share of information-rich scientists in co-authorship networks correlates highly with that nation’s progress in research topics. These results indicate that scientists’ relationships continue to dominate scientific evolution in the age of open access to information and explain the failure or success of nations’ investments in science.},

Possible new market areas are identiﬁed and described.

It is found that the business potential of polymer solar cells is large when taking the projections for future performance into account while the currently available performance and manufacturing cost leaves little room for competition on the thin ﬁlm photovoltaic market. However, polymer solar cells do enable the competitive manufacture of low cost niche products and is viewed as ﬁnancially viable in its currently available form in a large volume approximation. Finally, it is found that the polymer solar cell technology is very poorly protected in Europe with the central patents being valid in only France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Several countries with a large potential for PV such as Portugal and Greece are completely open and have apparently no relevant patents. This is viewed as a great advantage for the possible commercialization of polymer solar cells in a European setting as the competition for the market will be based on the manufacturing performance rather than domination by a few patent stakeholders.},

This study was conducted in three stages: data collection, network creation, and network analysis. For network analysis, network visualization, network topological analysis, and node centrality analysis were performed in sequence. The network topological analysis revealed that all three citation networks, i.e., countries, institutions, and technology ﬁelds, are scale-free networks that follow the power law and display, to a greater or lesser extent, a more efﬁcient knowledge transfer capability than a random network of the same size. The node centrality analysis showed that the United States, Japan, and Germany are the most important citation centers in the country citation network, while Boeing, Konarka Technologies, Eastman Kodak, and Sharp are the most important in the institution citation network, and the U.S. patent classiﬁcation (USPC) classes of 136, 257, and 428 are the most important in the technology ﬁeld citation network, each playing critical roles in each the network as core nodes. In this study, we applied various concepts of centrality to the analysis of individual nodes and found that the results from the network topological analysis and the node centrality analysis are not signiﬁcantly different. The proposed analysis framework in this paper is applicable to different science and technology domains. \& 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This article examines this technology’s development from the perspective of patent growth analysis. Patent data are analyzed to ﬁnd the photovoltaic technology growth trajectory. Mainly affected by environmental factors such as the price of crude oil, we observe two long-term waves of development trajectories. The current wave is found to be in the later growth stage of its life-cycle. After examining the correlation between technology development and crude oil price, a signiﬁcant correlation is found between crude oil price’s growth rate and photovoltaic patents’ growth rate. As far as the market is concerned, it lags 10 years behind photovoltaic technology development.},

	abstract = {Against the pressing challenges of climate change and fossil fuel depletion, renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics (PV) are considered a clean and sustainable alternative. PV technologies have grown into a substantial ﬁeld of research and development through large stocks of scientiﬁc publications and patents. Besides cell technologies, the balance of system (BoS) components such as panels, electronics and energy storage form an important research area. The present article studies the development of the PV technological system using patent indicators. It is composed of three parts: First, it deﬁnes the system by thoroughly reviewing the various cell and BoS technologies. Second, it introduces a novel methodical approach for identifying its relevant patents. In that sense, the paper contributes with an accurate inventory of international patent classes for PV system. Finally, the geographical, organizational and technical trends over the past six decades are analysed along with a review of the most inﬂuential inventions. The analysis shows that 95\% of the PV patent applications were ﬁled by inventors from seven countries: Japan, Korea, China, USA, Germany, Taiwan, and France. Most patents were ﬁled by companies and related to thin-ﬁlm and crystalline-silicon cells as well as panel encapsulation and supporting structures. The analysis reviews the quantity, quality and technological specialization within countries’ patent proﬁles. It further provides an overview of the technological landscape and freedom-spaces available for manufacturers.},

The paper explores the spatiotemporal evolution of the PV value chain based on priority patent applications from a global perspective. Our findings highlight the global innovation activities in developing PV technology are uneven in the temporal dimension, and the center of PV technology innovation has experienced a rapid spatial shift in the context of globalization. Developing the PV technological components was initially concentrated in a few countries or regions and then showed a tendency for spatial dispersion. However, the development of PV technology concentrated again after the global financial crisis. Moreover, there are distinct comparative tech­ nology advantages and disadvantages of the PV technological components or trajectories across crucial countries or regions. Our findings contribute to a theoretical description of the spatiotemporal evolution of developing PV technology at a global level and help policy-makers or company managers better understand the evolution of the PV industrial value chain from the perspective of the global innovation system.},

Two recently developed techniques for making patent maps with interactive overlays—geographical ones using Google Maps and maps based on citation relations among International Patent Classifications (IPC)—are elaborated into dynamic versions that allow for online animations and comparisons by using split screens. Various forms of animation are discussed. The longitudinal development of Rao-Stirling diversity in the IPC-based maps provided us with a heuristics for studying technological diversity in terms of generations of the technology. The longitudinal patterns are clear in USPTO data more than in PatStat data because PatStat aggregates patent information from countries in different stages of technological development, whereas one can expect USPTO patents to be competitive at the technological edge.},

This study focuses on the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, which is a major sector in the renewable energy industry and plays a key role in achieving energy transition. As a critical application for semiconductors, PV technologies have grown into a substantial field of research and development through strong patents. In this study, we found that the quality and applicability scope of a patent, as well as the market size, manufacturing capacity, and imitation threats in a destination country, can impact international patent extensions in the solar PV industry. We also found that the strength of these motivators varies based on different types of technologies and assignees.},

	abstract = {Climate-relevant technologies, like wind and solar energy, are crucial for mitigating climate change and for achieving sustainable development. Recent literature argues that Chinese solar firms play more active roles in international knowledge flows, which may better explain their success in international markets when compared to those of Chinese wind firms; however, empirical evidence remains sparse. This study aims to explore to what extent and how do the international knowledge flows differ between China’s wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) industries? From a network perspective, this paper develops a three-dimensional framework to compare the knowledge flows in both explicit and tacit dimensions: (i) inter-country explicit knowledge clusters (by topological clustering of patent citation network); (ii) inter-firm explicit knowledge flow (patent citation network of key firms); and, (iii) inter-firm tacit knowledge flow (by desktop research and interviews). The results show that China’s PV industry has stronger international knowledge linkages in terms of knowledge clustering and explicit knowledge flow, but the wind power industry has a stronger tacit knowledge flow. Further, this study argues that the differences of global knowledge links between China’s wind and solar PV industries may be caused by technology characteristics, market orientation, and policy implementation. This suggests that these industries both have strong connections to global knowledge networks, but they may involve disparate catch-up pathways that concern follower-modes and leader-modes. These findings are important to help us understand how China can follow sustainable development pathways in the light of climate change.},

Such an exercise is instrumental for private companies and research institutes aiming at both internal or external technology creation. We discuss our ﬁndings in the context of the Industrial Life Cycle model and ﬁnd OPV still residing in the ﬂuid technology development phase. Technology development is still following an exponential growth path, with the majority of patents coming from the Asian continent and in general private companies. For devices, the main technological focus can be traced back to the “H01L-031” international patent classiﬁcation (IPC) main group. For the queried substrates, the most attention has gone to glass, but paper and textile have drawn signiﬁcant interest too. Finally, encapsulation is found to be a less mature research ﬁeld given the smaller number of patent families. The latter shows that the technology has not matured to the level where processing is carried out on a commercial scale.},

In particular, 5G photonic technology is an interdisciplinary technology that could create considerable potential business opportunities in the future, therefore, identifying related key technologies is crucial. Accordingly, the patents of 5G photonic technologies were used as the basis for analysis in this study, and a patent technology network for such technologies was constructed using network analysis. The results showed that the key technologies of 5G photonic technology are mainly related to optics, nanostructures, semiconductors, and material analysis, indicating an interdisciplinary feature instead of focusing only on one specific technological field. Additionally, the relevant technologies that have seen active development in recent years are mainly related to optical elements and semiconductor devices. Finally, a patentee analysis demonstrated that information technology companies were the key players in the development of 5G photonic technologies, and the semiconductor industry will have a crucial role in the development of such technologies. In this study, a patent technology network model was constructed to explore the development trend of 5G photonic technologies, thereby providing a reference for the government to promote these emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {Patent pools collect patents from multiple patentees and license them out as a package. They offer one-stop-shop licensing efficiencies, reduce transaction costs, and increase the predictability of the licensing environment for the benefit of innovation diffusion. However, pools failed to take off for previous cellular standards. This article analyses both retrospectively the reasons for such failures and prospectively what makes the 5G environment more conductive to pool formation and licensing. Avanci, a patent pool for licensing cellular standards in the Internet of Things (IoT), is a significant development but has limited licensing coverage so far. The article then recom­ mends five policy principles to facilitate pool licensing in the IoT. They include recognising that only enough upstream SEP owners need to join the 5G pool to create a market signalling effect. Some vertically integrated SEP owners may remain outsiders, and some bilateral licensing may co-exist without damaging the pool’s success. To encourage upstream SEP owners to join the pool, they should be allowed to set ‘high enough’ royalty rates and divide pools’ royalties among members under value proportionality rules. 5G pools must also be flexible and adopt different licensing programs that consider the specificities of each IoT market. Finally, pool administrators should consult with IoT implementers before establishing licensing programs for them and have infringement legal standing if everything else fails. These principles would go a long way in spurring the broader use of 5G pool licensing for a more efficient, straightforward, and predict­ able IoT licensing environment.},

This paper contributes to a better understanding of the accumulation process of indigenous innovation capabilities in emerging economies. It empirically analyses the case of photovoltaic (PV) technologies in China between 1988 and 2014 using patent indicators with a comprehensive deﬁnition of the entire system value chain. The contribution tracks the technological catching-up trajectory of the PV innovators in China and their collaboration networks against institutional milestones of industrial policy. Theoretically, the research draws on the concepts of innovation capabilities and technological systems. Methodologically, the paper uses patent indicators and network analysis to study patent co-application activities. The analysis shows a gap between China’s share in the global PV market and its modest share of transnational patents. However, it gives evidence for a gradual technological catching-up in the 1G cell technologies, solar panels, and electronics. This catching-up is being driven by an increasing population of Chinese patent applicants clustered in isolated communities. The role of foreign actors in the co-patenting activities is surprisingly low and decreasing.},

	abstract = {Economic transformation -- change in what an economy produces -- is foundational to development and rising standards of living. Our understanding of this process has been propelled recently by two branches of work in the field of economic complexity, one studying how economies diversify, the other how the complexity of an economy is expressed in the makeup of its output. However, the connection between these branches is not well understood, nor how they relate to a classic understanding of structural transformation. Here, we present a simple dynamical modeling framework that unifies these areas of work, based on the widespread observation that economies diversify preferentially into activities that are related to ones they do already. We show how stylized facts of long-run structural change, as well as complexity metrics, can both emerge naturally from this one observation. However, complexity metrics take on new meanings, as descriptions of the long-term changes an economy experiences rather than measures of complexity per se. This suggests relatedness and complexity metrics are connected, in a hitherto overlooked way: Both describe structural change, on different time scales. Whereas relatedness probes transformation on short time scales, complexity metrics capture long-term change.},

	abstract = {Although ubiquitous, interactions in groups of individuals are not yet thoroughly studied. Frequently, single groups are modeled as critical-mass dynamics, which is a widespread concept used not only by academics but also by politicians and the media. However, less explored questions are how a collection of groups will behave and how their intersection might change the dynamics. Here, we formulate this process as binary-state dynamics on hypergraphs. We showed that our model has a rich behavior beyond discontinuous transitions. Notably, we have multistability and intermittency. We demonstrated that this phenomenology could be associated with community structures, where we might have multistability or intermittency by controlling the number or size of bridges between communities. Furthermore, we provided evidence that the observed transitions are hybrid. Our findings open new paths for research, ranging from physics, on the formal calculation of quantities of interest, to social sciences, where new experiments can be designed.},

Increasing technological complexity, miniaturization and the generalization of markets for technology have induced higher integration constraints for designers. The pace of innovation and frequent changes in design rules require a tightly controlled design process. As a consequence, knowledge integrators must develop expertise beyond the scope of their domain of activity if they are to ascertain the overall efficiency of systems. We find that although internalization of knowledge integration reduces coordination and agency-related costs, the involvement of partner firms in upstream design phases facilitates knowledge sharing and improves the coordination of innovation in modules. The analysis of the evolution of the ASICs industry shows that while large system integrators remain the dominant players, specialist firms are gaining market shares and do not hesitate to embark on the design of leading-edge systems. This result may simply reveal the increasing value of component knowledge in a disaggregated value chain. However, relying on a comparative case study of two similar development processes (one with each of the knowledge integration approaches) we confirm the strength of decentralized modes of governance on the condition that partner firms engage in a long-term relationship.}",

	abstract = {An industrial process usually has multiple operating conditions or periods due to various factors such as the fluctuation of raw material quality, differences of worker levels, and changes of product specifications. Industrial data from different operating conditions or periods have different statistical characteristics, namely multimode behavior. In fact, multimode recognition of industrial processes is the first problem to develop effective intelligent manufacturing strategies for engineers. The clustering-based methods can help them characterize multimode behavior in historical databases and group them together with little detailed knowledge of the process. However, these methods are facing the challenges of massive high-dimensional industrial big data and unknown mode number. This study proposes a construction method of complex network to describe the potential relationship in industrial big data. The topological structure of complex network can be acquired by taking the correlation matrix of multi-variables as nodes and the similarity between correlation matrices as edges. On this basis, community detection technology is employed to reveal the aggregation behavior of nodes in network. It takes the maximum modularity as the optimization objective, and partitions each node into one community through greedy search algorithm, where a community denotes a mode of industrial process. Finally, case studies have demonstrated the proposed method has good performance and application prospects.},

A novel panel Granger approach proposed by Juodis et al. (2021) is adopted. Under this approach, we can explore the Granger causality in homogeneous or heterogeneous panels. To uncover the heterogeneous causal effects at different income levels, this study further divide the sample into three groups according to their annual income levels. Empirical results show that there are bi-directional causalities among economic growth, economic complexity and CO2 emissions for all groups. However, the magnitudes of the effects are heterogeneous for different groups. As to low-income countries, economic complexity is positive and significant for CO2 emissions, while CO2 emissions are negative for economic complexity. Furthermore, there is a positive interaction between economic complexity and CO2 emissions for middle-income countries. Regarding high-income countries, however, increasing economic complexity might effectively reduce CO2 emissions, and CO2 emissions can significantly increase economic complexity. Additionally, economic complexity will prominently decrease GDP in low-income countries. These findings are robust to different economic complexity indexes. Our results suggest that both developing and developed countries should set a reasonable CO2 emissions target, and on this basis, maintain a good balance between economic complexity and CO2 emissions.},

This may help reduce small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants, but may also increase large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants. This study performed hypothetical experiments to determine effective GWG advice based on quantile regression analysis. In a total of 354,401 singleton pregnancies registered in the perinatal database of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013–2017), the proportions of SGA and LGA were 9.33\% and 11.13\%, respectively. Using regression coefficients of GWG across the birth weight-for-gestational-age quantile distribution, we analyzed changes in their proportions by simulating a uniform 3-kg extra increase in GWG or an increase or decrease based on GWG adequacy. A hypothetical experiment of a uniform increase in GWG resulted in SGA and LGA proportions of 7.26\% (95\% confidence interval 7.15–7.36) and 14.51\% (14.37–14.66), respectively. By contrast, assuming a 3-kg increase in women with inadequate GWG and a 3-kg decrease in women with excessive GWG resulted in SGA and LGA proportions of 8.42\% (8.31–8.54) and 11.50\% (11.37–11.62), respectively. Our real-world data analysis suggests that careful adjustment of GWG based on GWG adequacy will be effective in optimizing infant birth weight in Japan},

Despite a millenary settlement history, such issue has been rarely investigated in Europe, and especially in highly divided countries such as those in the Mediterranean region. Using econometric modeling to manage spatial heterogeneity, our study verifies the role of selected drivers of population growth at ten times between 1921 and 2021 in more than 8000 Italian municipalities verifying density-dependent and path-dependent dynamics. Results of global and quantile (spatial) regressions highlight a differential impact of density and (lagged) population growth on demographic dynamics along the urban cycle in Italy. Being weakly significant in the inter-war period (1921–1951), econometric models totalized a high goodness-of-fit in correspondence with compact urbanization (1951–1981). Model’s fit declined in the following decades (1981–2021) reflecting suburbanization and counter-urbanization. Density-dependence and path-dependence were found significant and, respectively, positive or negative, with compact urbanization, and much less intense with suburbanization and counter-urbanization. A spatial econometric investigation of density-dependent and path-dependent mechanisms of population dynamics provided an original explanation of metropolitan cycles, delineating the evolution of socioeconomic (local) systems along the urban-rural gradient.},

On the contrary, when using their industrial share as a proxy to capture the countries’ economic structure, the EKC hypothesis is not confirmed – but a U-shaped relationship is confirmed. The industrial share decreases emissions through the development and absorption of technologies that are energy efficient and environmental friendly. The EKC hypothesis is confirmed when the aggregate GDP growth is considered, taking into account the improvement of the overall economic conditions of the countries regardless of the economic structure and role of industrialization.},

This study expands the traditional EKC theory by adding social indicator, which also corresponds to the three aspects (social, economic, and environmental) required for sustainable development in 2030. Based on the panel data of 134 countries from 1996 to 2015, the threshold regression model is applied to investigate the non-linear causality between the variables. The threshold variable is urbanization, and the impact mechanism of economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprint is tested. The results show that: urbanization strengthens the positive correlation between the economy and carbon emissions and ecological footprint. The positive effect of economic growth on the ecological footprint is greater than that of carbon emissions. Trade openness and natural resource rents increase environmental pressure. Population aging and renewable energy improve the quality of the environment. There is heterogeneity in the values and change trend of the regression coefficients of different income groups. Unlike the coefficient growth trend in the results of all countries, the following situations occur. As urbanization successively crosses the threshold, the positive effect of economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions in high income countries diminishes. The coefficient of the lower middle income group has an inverted U-shape. When the ecological footprint is the explained variable, the coefficient of the high income group becomes U-shaped.},

	abstract = {Environmental degradation has profoundly impacted both human society and ecosystems. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) illuminates the intricate relationship between economic growth and environmental decline. However, the recent surge in trade protectionism has heightened global economic uncertainties, posing a severe threat to global environmental sustainability. This research aims to investigate the intricate pathways through which trade protection, assessed by available trade openness data, influences the nexus between economic growth and environmental degradation. Leveraging comprehensive global panel data spanning 147 countries from 1995 to 2018, this study meticulously examines the non-linear dynamics among trade, economy, and the environment, with a particular emphasis on validating the EKC hypothesis. This study encompasses exhaustive global and panel data regressions categorized across four income groups. The research substantiates the validity of the EKC hypothesis within the confines of this investigation. As income levels rise, the impact of economic growth on environmental degradation initially intensifies before displaying a diminishing trend. Additionally, trade protection manifests as a detriment to improving global environmental quality. The ramifications of trade protectionism display nuanced variations across income strata. In high-income nations, trade protection appears to contribute to mitigating environmental degradation. Conversely, within other income brackets, the stimulating effect of trade protection on environmental pressure is more conspicuous. In other words, trade protectionism exacerbates environmental degradation, particularly affecting lower-income countries, aligning with the concept of pollution havens. The study’s results illuminate nuanced thresholds in the relationship between trade, economic growth, and environmental degradation across income groups, emphasizing the heterogeneous impact and underlying mechanisms. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, urging collaborative efforts among nations to achieve a harmonious balance between economic advancement and environmental preservation on a global scale.},

	abstract = {The manufacturing and construction industries have significantly contributed to the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is widely leveraged to analyze the peak of CO2 emissions, which is considered as a pivotal step for the effective CO2 emission reduction in previous studies. This study tests the EKC hypothesis using the data of CO2 emissions of manufacturing and construction industries from 121 countries throughout 1960–2014, and turning points (TPs) are calculated for the countries where EKC hypothesis is validated. The results show that the EKC hypothesis was validated by 95 out of 121 countries, among which, 13 countries have not reached any of the three TPs, 11 countries have reached the first-step TP (TPCI), 21 countries have reached the second-step TP (TPPC), and 50 countries have reached the third-step TP (TPTC). Moreover, the result of examination of the EKC existence at four income levels indicates the higher-income nations own a higher proportion of countries validates the EKC hypothesis and reach the TP. These findings help policy-makers analyze the TP status quo and generate step-wise strategies for national CO2 emission reduction of manufacturing and construction industries.},

There remain gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these links, in part because they are difficult to analyse with highly aggregated, official data sources that do not capture the emergence of new industrial activities, a potential benefit from complexity. We seek to address some of these gaps by calculating two indices of economic complexity for functional local economies (Travel to Work Areas) in Great Britain, and explore their link with these locations’ economic performance. Seeking to gain a better understanding of the mechanism connecting economic complexity with economic performance, we create a measure of emergent technological activity in a location based on a combination of novel data sources including text from UK business websites and CrunchBase, a technology company directory, and study its link with economic complexity. Our results highlight the potential value of novel, unstructured data sources for the analysis of the links between economic complexity and regional economic development.},

Has the change in geopolitics in recent years affected the international collaboration in the study of the EKC? Based on the publications on the EKC included in the Web of Science, a case study of recent changes in China–US collaboration on the EKC is conducted to explore the impact of geopolitical changes on international collaborative research on sustainable development. The results show that (1) The EKC is a global study, and countries around the world have made more efforts, among which China, the United States, Turkey, Malaysia, England and other countries have made the most contributions in the global literature database and are the countries with the most development potential in this field. (2) International collaboration between China and the United States in this field has gradually increased, and scientific research collaboration between the two countries has increased under the influence of geopolitical conflicts, and collaboration has shown the characteristics of lasting stability. (3) China and the United States exhibit divergent international collaboration patterns, with Pakistan being China's foremost partner in this domain, while China serves as the US’ primary collaborator. Furthermore, China demonstrates a significantly higher volume of independently published works compared with the United States, highlighting the strengthening of China's scientific research capabilities. The number of countries collaborating internationally with China shows a different upward trend than in the United States across the three data sets set in this paper. (4) In the field of EKC hot research, China and the United States have maintained good international partnerships with other countries, and are the preferred countries for scientific research collaboration in other countries in the world. It can be seen from this that international scientific research collaboration for sustainable development represented by the EKC has shown relative stability, and geopolitical changes have not had a significant impact on international collaborative research for sustainable development.},

The current study incorporates natural resources rent to the model as an additional variable. Empirical evidence is based on a balanced panel data between annual periods of 1996--2014 for selected EU-16 countries. The Kao test reveals a cointegration between carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, natural resources rent, renewable, and nonrenewable energy consumption. The Panel Pooled Mean Group-Autoregressive Auto regressive distributive lag model (PMG-ARDL) suggests a positive significant relationship between the countries' natural resource rent and CO2 emissions in the long-run. Implying that the overdependence on natural resource rent affects environmental sustainability of the panel countries if conservation and management options are ignored. Our study affirms that nonrenewable energy consumption and economic growth increase carbon emission flaring while renewable energy consumption declines CO2 emissions. The panel causality analysis reveals a feedback mechanism between economic growth, renewable, and nonrenewable energy consumption. We further observed a feedback causality between natural resources rent and economic growth. Effective policy implications could be drawn toward modern and environmentally friendly energy sources, especially in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {We examine the causal relationship between globalisation and CO2 emissions for 25 developed economies in Asia, North America, Western Europe and Oceania using both time series and panel data techniques, spanning the annual data period of 1970--2014. Because of the presence of cross-sectional dependence in the panel, we employ Pesaran's Journal of Applied Econometrics 22, 265--312 (2007) cross-sectional augmented panel unit root (CIPS) test to ascertain unit root properties. The Westerlund Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 69, 709--748 (2007) cointegration test is also used to ascertain the presence of a long-run association between globalisation and carbon emissions. The long-run heterogeneous panel elasticities are estimated using the Pesaran Econometrica, 74(4), 967--1012 (2006) common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) estimator and the Eberhardt and Teal Productivity analysis in global manufacturing production (2010) augmented mean group (AMG) estimator. The causality between the variables is examined by employing the Dumitrescu and Hurlin Economic Modelling, 29, 1450--1460 (2012) and Emirmahmutoglu and Kose Economic Modelling, 28, 870--876 (2011) Granger causality tests. The empirical results reveal that globalisation increases carbon emissions, and thus, the globalisation-driven carbon emission hypothesis is valid. This empirical analysis suggests insightful policy guidelines for policy makers using `globalisation'as an economic tool for better long-run environmental policy.},

	abstract = {CO2 emissions mitigation in iron and steel industry (ISI) and construction material industry (CMI), including cement, glass, and ceramics materials, is crucial for the realization of CO2 emission peak targets in China, given their great contributions to China's emission structure. Great transitions have occurred in the two industries recently, including scale expansion, efficiency improvement, and changes in production and demand structures. By developing an integrated framework for inter-sector linkage analysis, we investigated the impact of recent transitions in the ISI and CMI on China's CO2 emissions between 1992 and 2012. Results show that the CO2 emissions from ISI and CMI increased by 4.2 and 6.8 times over two decades, respectively, and the two key sectors have significantly higher backward and forward linkages than average in terms of CO2 emissions. The internal efficiency improvement of the ISI and CMI are crucial factors curbing the rising CO2 emissions in these two sectors. The total CO2 intensity of the ISI and CMI have declined by 78% and 68%, separately, cumulatively reducing 517 Mt and 704 Mt CO2 emissions during the studied period. The external final demand growth and its structure changes of the ISI and CMI have had a significant impact on their CO2 emissions. The construction sector is the greatest consumer, responsible for 53% and 86% emissions increase of ISI and CMI during 2002--2012, respectively. Emerging manufacturing and machinery also became substantial emissions sources, generating 536 Mt CO2 emissions in 2012 by consuming iron and steel products. Based on these findings, policy recommendations for CO2 emissions mitigation in the two key sectors and their related sectors are also discussed.},

In that respect, this research investigates how various economic sectors affect environmental pollution differently. The results confirm the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, which implies the influential role of economic structure and complexity in socio-economic developmental phases. In addition, the results show that most of the OECD countries are on the left side of the curve, implying positive connection between economic complexity and CO2 emissions. In contrast, only 3 OECD countries (Japan, Switzerland, and Germany) are close to the turning point, indicating that their patterns are sustainable for socio-economic development. The sectoral economic results affirm the most pollutant structure of the service sector, compared with the other economic sectors. Hence, new projects should attach great attention to their environmental impacts, specifically in the service sector planning. Regarding the complexity analysis, policymakers are advised to embrace knowledge-intensive restructuring of economic sectors.},

Despite this, the EKC was criticized almost from the start and decomposition approaches have been more popular in other disciplines working on global climate change. More recently, convergence approaches to modeling emissions have become popular. This paper reviews the history of the EKC and alternative approaches. Applying an approach that synthesizes the EKC and convergence approaches, I show that convergence is important for explaining both pollution emissions and concentrations. On the other hand, economic growth has a strong positive effect on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but weaker effects on non-industrial GHG emissions and concentrations of particulates. Negative time effects are important for sulfur and industrial and non-industrial GHG emissions. Even for particulate concentrations, economic growth only reduces pollution at very high income levels. Future research should focus on developing and testing alternative theoretical models and investigating the non-growth drivers of pollution reduction.},

In a field where the Gross Domestic Product remains the preferred indicator for many, economic complexity measures, aiming at uncovering the productive knowledge of countries, have been stirring the pot in the past few years. The commonly used methodologies to measure economic complexity produce contrasting results, undermining their acceptance and applications. Here we show that these methodologies – apparently conflicting on fundamental aspects – can be reconciled by adopting a neat mathematical perspective based on linear-algebra tools within a bipartite-networks framework. The obtained results shed new light on the potential of economic complexity to trace and forecast countries’ innovation potential and to interpret the temporal dynamics of economic growth, possibly paving the way to a micro-foundation of the field.},

	abstract = {Environmental changes based on factors like urbanization, population, economic growth, increase in energy consumption, and agricultural intensiﬁcation are never far from the top of any agenda. The topics of environmental degradation and climate change cannot be conﬁned to a single country or region but need to be addressed on a global scale. If the focus is on the relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth, then one hypothesis that is comprehensively used as an empirically model is the widely known Environmental Kuznets Curve. A substantial amount of research has been published about the Environmental Kuznets Curve, and this present study provides a detailed and extensive literature review of more than 200 articles from 1998 to 2022 to explain and assess its evolution. This literature review provides in detail the Environmental Kuznets Curve relationship under analysis, the additional variables included, the type of analysis and methods performed, the relationships obtained, and if the turning point is calculated. Furthermore, this comprehensive literature points out critical issues and gaps in the Environmental Kuznets Curve analysis. It is important to note that there are components that are not considered in the Environmental Kuznets Curve analysis. The Environmental Kuznets Curve only focuses on production and overlooks the impact of the consumption of imported goods on the environment. Consequently, environmental improvements from technological progress will be offset, and economic growth will result in more environmental degradation. This goes against the change in consumer behaviour which occurs with a rise in income, which is one basic assumption of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. The relocation of pollutant industries and consequent relocation of emissions could distort the emissions trajectory over the economic growth path and is also not considered in the Environmental Kuznets Curve analysis. On the other hand, the growth path traced by the inverted U-shaped is not efﬁcient, and the environmental damage provoked in the ﬁrst phases of the EKC might not be repairable. Therefore, technological progress, climate ﬁnance, and energy transition could improve the Environmental Kuznets Curve assessment.},

	abstract = {In order to mitigate emissions, the European Union (EU) countries have implemented several legislative regulations. At the same time, the importance of trade in EU countries increased, which opened up an opportunity for carbon leakage. These two factors raise the question regarding the validity of the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The study veriﬁes the validity of the EKC hypothesis in the EU countries in the period between 1970 and 2017 by testing three EKC speciﬁcations, comparing the validity of the EKC for production-based emissions (PBA) and consumption-based emissions (CBA), and extending the analysis period to cover the effects of energy transformation. Due to the heterogeneity of the analysed countries, the ARDL testing bound approach is used. The results reveal that in most countries, the EKC models fail to explain the relationship between income and PBA emissions in the period 1970e2017. In most analysed cases, all three EKC speciﬁcations indicate no longterm relationship. The results obtained for CBA emissions also reject the EKC hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis postulates an inverted-U-shaped relationship between different pollutants and per capita income, i.e., environmental pressure increases up to a certain level as income goes up; after that, it decreases. An EKC actually reveals how a technically specified measurement of environmental quality changes as the fortunes of a country change. A sizeable literature on EKC has grown in recent period. The common point of all the studies is the assertion that the environmental quality deteriorates at the early stages of economic development/growth and subsequently improves at the later stages. In other words, environmental pressure increases faster than income at early stages of development and slows down relative to GDP growth at higher income levels. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with EKC phenomenon. Possible explanations for this EKC are seen in (i) the progress of economic development, from clean agrarian economy to polluting industrial economy to clean service economy; (ii) tendency of people with higher income having higher preference for environmental quality, etc. Evidence of the existence of the EKC has been questioned from several corners. Only some air quality indicators, especially local pollutants, show the evidence of an EKC. However, an EKC is empirically observed, till there is no agreement in the literature on the income level at which environmental degradation starts declining. This paper provides an overview of the EKC literature, background history, conceptual insights, policy and the conceptual and methodological critique.},

The digital maps of administrative boundary were used to clip urban regions from scenes of the satellite images. The clipped images were classiﬁed into a binary class: urban built-up and others. The sectoral data for the CO2 emissions at the municipality level in 2005 were obtained from published sources. We used two types of approaches to quantify urban forms. The ﬁrst method involved landscape metrics which describe compactness and complexity of settlement patches. Second method, which we developed, quantiﬁes the reduction rate of urban area from the city center by applying ring-shaped buffers. The results indicated that there were correlations between spatial indices of urban form and sectoral CO2 emissions for the residential and passenger transport sectors. The inverse relationship between the compactness index and CO2 emissions in our study suggest that less fragmented and compact cities emit less CO2 from the passenger transportation sector than the sprawled cities. Our study indicates that less complex cities lower residential per capita CO2 emissions but too dense settlements in mono-centric form may lead to greater per capita CO2 emissions. Complexity seems to have less signiﬁcant for CO2 emissions in general. Our research also favors a high income, smaller population size and denser city for lower CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Given that structural transformation plays an important role in countries’ growth efforts, various reforms are required in many different areas to produce more technologically intensive, efficient and more information-intensive production patterns. The goal of this study is to explore the underlying nexus between structural transformation (economic-complexity) and income inequality. The empirical analysis tests the Kuznets curve hypothesis in a large country sample (65 countries), spanning the period 1990–2015 and employing the system-GMM (generalized method of moments) technique. For addressing the heterogeneity issues, we have classified the panel data sets into sub-panels based on income across the countries. The empirical outcomes demonstrate that economic complexity has a significant negative bearing on income inequality, indicating that increase in structural transformation tends to improve income distribution. The results further indicate that there is wideranging heterogeneity across country-groups as far as the impact of economic complexity on inequality of income distribution is concerned. The poorest sample set of countries have the highest impact of economic complexity on inequality of income distribution. The findings remain consistent across modelling specifications and income-levels. They also imply that production structure demonstrates a high-resolution illustration of a number of determinants, running from organizations to human capital, that evolves around the country’s production process and export diversification along with inclusiveness of the economic system. We argue that the economies with lesser levels of education and lower degrees of trade-openness fails to reduce the inequality in the distribution of income. The empirical outcomes of this study are appropriate for policy planners in tailor-making the policies towards reducing income inequality at the backdrop of the Sustainable Development Goal10. Unarguably, the poorest set of countries in the sample set needs to put the structural transformation process foremost on the agenda.},

	abstract = {Existing studies show the important influence of economic complexity index (ECI) on environmental quality, but do not consider the mediating effect of other key factors on the relationship between the two, thus ignoring the structural break and nonlinear characteristics of the relationship between ECI and environmental quality. To fill this research gap, this study constructs a decomposition framework and multiple panel threshold regression models based on an extended STIRPAT model using panel data from 36 OECD countries to explore the nonlinear relationship between ECI and ecological footprint (an indicator of environmental quality) in terms of three key mediators: energy consumption structure, industrial structure, and human capital. The results show that a 1\% increase in economic complexity is associated with a 0.075\% increase in ecological footprint per capita, and an increase in economic complexity is detrimental to environmental improvement. When energy consumption structure is used as the threshold variable, the correlation coefficient between ECI and ecological footprint per capita gradually shifts from positive to negative with an inverted U-shaped curve as the share of renewable energy consumption increases. In particular, when the share of renewable energy consumption is higher than 44.56\%, ECI shows a negative correlation with ecological footprint, i.e., ECI promotes the improvement of environmental quality. When the industrial structure is used as the threshold variable, the coefficient change from the below-threshold stage to the above-threshold stage indicates that the reduction of per capita ecological footprint shrinks from 0.161\% to 0.102\% for each 1\% increase in ECI. The increase in the human capital index suppresses the positive effect of ECI on the ecological footprint per capita, i.e., the technology effect mitigates the environmental pressure caused by ECI, and only a country with a human capital index above 2.60 is in the interval where the technology effect comes into play. Finally, targeted policy recommendations from the perspective of the energy structure, industrial structure, and labor force are proposed to mitigate the effects of economic complexity on environmental quality.},

The study sampled 29 Asia-Pacific coun­ tries over the period 2000–2018. The relationship between the complexity index and CO2 emissions has been investigated using panel data models and estimation methods. According to the findings, increasing the intensity of energy use, trade openness, and urbanization all increase CO2 emissions, although the effects of urbanization eventually became insignificant in the long run. Furthermore, while the logarithm of GDP per capita’s co­ efficients for the level and squared forms confirmed the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, the economic complexity index shifted the curve. The results indicate that economic complexity in countries en­ hances economic growth effects to increase CO2 emissions through increased production scale and energy de­ mand. On the other hand, increasing economic complexity through increased energy efficiency demonstrates its beneficial effects on the environment. According to the findings, increasing wind and solar energy share has reduced CO2 emissions in countries with lower economic complexity. In comparison, in more complex countries along with these substitution effects, there is also a scale effect associated with increasing renewable energy use, which eventually results in increased CO2 emissions.},

The present study employs robust econometric techniques including Augmented Mean Group with Fully Modified-Ordinary Least Squares esti­ mators as estimation techniques. Empirical outcome shows both inverted U-Shaped and N-Shaped EKC rela­ tionship between ECI and CO2 emission. The empirical findings also lend support to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, which suggest that foreign direct investment influx is a contributing factor to environmental degradation in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa economies. Furthermore, renewable energy and the interaction between economic complexity index and urbanization is found to have adverse impact on emission while natural resources and urbanization have positive impact on the environment. Finally, the results from the Dumitrecu and Hurlin causality reveals a bi-directional causality between economic complexity and CO2 emis­ sion. Similar causality is found between economic complexity index and urbanization and CO2 emission while a one-way causality is seen running from foreign direct investment to CO2 emission over study period. These findings encourage authorities of the investigated countries to offer a broader energy strategy on alternative energies i.e., renewables improve Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa environmental quality. Furthermore, emphasis on economic strategies that foster a healthier manufacturing activity to engender envi­ ronmental sustainability without compromise for economic prosperity should be pursued among the examined economies.},

This paper's unique contribution is that it investigates for the ﬁrst time the moderating role of an environmental tax on renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, natural resources rent and CO2 emissions. The results suggest that environmental taxes effectively reduce emissions for the G7 countries and conﬁrm that the marginal effects of the environmental tax on traditional energy consumption, natural resources rent and renewable energy consumption rise with the level of taxation in a statistically signiﬁcant way.

            Modern macroeconomic theories were unable to foresee the last Great Recession and could neither predict its prolonged duration nor the recovery rate. They are based on supply−demand equilibria that do not exist during recessionary shocks. Here we focus on resilience as a nonequilibrium property of networked production systems and develop a linear response theory for input−output economics. By calibrating the framework to data from 56 industrial sectors in 43 countries between 2000 and 2014, we find that the susceptibility of individual industrial sectors to economic shocks varies greatly across countries, sectors, and time. We show that susceptibility-based growth predictions that take sector- and country-specific recovery into account, outperform—by far—standard econometric models. Our results are analytically rigorous, empirically testable, and flexible enough to address policy-relevant scenarios. We illustrate the latter by estimating the impact of recently imposed tariffs on US imports (steel and aluminum) on specific sectors across European countries.},

	abstract = {The global imperative to mitigate carbon emissions for sustainable development has spurred extensive research into economic, social, and energy-related factors. However, prior studies present a complex landscape, yielding mixed conclusions regarding the influence of geopolitical risk, natural resource rents, corrupt governance, and energy intensity. To untangle this ambiguity, we construct a research model grounded in the Environmental Kuznets Curve, employing panel data from 38 countries spanning 2002 to 2020. Employing panel quantile regression models, we directly assess the impact of identified factors. Our findings affirm the alignment between economic growth and carbon emissions, supporting the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. Notably, increased geopolitical risk and energy intensity correlate with heightened carbon emissions over time, while corruption governance and natural resource rents exhibit a mitigating effect. Additionally, our study explores the indirect impact of these factors using a panel threshold regression model. Results indicate a diminishing influ­ ence of economic growth on carbon emissions. Intriguingly, natural resource rents initially curtail, then amplify the connection between economic growth and carbon emissions. Conversely, rising energy intensity magnifies the relationship between economic expansion and carbon emissions.},

First, we conduct a literature review on the most well-known rationale behind the EKC prevalence and discuss the key components of the research design when estimating the EKC. Second, we bring together the most influential empirical papers published in the last decade, which focus on EKC estimation in developing and transition economies. Overall, succeeding to curtail some of the deficiencies suggested by theoretical contributions, the recent empirical studies might indicate a certain consensus regarding pollution-growth nexus, and EKC validity. On one hand, reinforcing the EKC nature, several studies reveal a long-run relationship between indicators. On the other hand, according to income coefficients’ signs, the traditional bell-shaped pattern seems to be at work for some developing and transition economies. However, in some cases, the estimated turning point lies outside the income sample range, calling into question not only the true pattern between pollution and growth but also the identification of EKC. Taken collectively, both the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, could contribute to a better understanding of the pollution-growth nexus in the EKC context, and suggest some useful insights into the future works on the subject as well as the crucial policy implications in this group of countries.},

A novel three-step approach in the analysis of the keyword co-occurrence networks (KCN) is proposed to identify the knowledge structure, knowledge clusters and trending keywords within AIED over time. The results reveal considerable research diversity in the AIED field, centering around two sustained themes: intelligent tutoring systems (2010-19) and massive open online courses (since 2014). The focal educational concerns reflected in AIED research are: (1) online learning; (2) game-based learning; (3) collaborative learning; (4) assessment; (5) affect; (6) engagement; and (7) learning design. The highly connected keywords relevant to analytic techniques within this field include natural language processing, educational data mining, learning analytics and machine learning. Neural network, deep learning, eye tracking, and personalized learning are trending keywords in this field as they have emerged with key structural roles in the latest two-year period analyzed. This is the first article providing a systematic review of a large body of literature on artificial intelligence in education, and in it we uncover the underlying patterns of knowledge connectivity within the field, as well as provide insight into its future development. The three-step multi-scale (macro, meso, micro) framework proposed in this study can also be applied to map the knowledge development in other scientific research areas.},

This two-sidedness motivates the idea that regions’ competitive advantages and, in consequence, their economic growth, originate in their ability to produce and utilize complex technologies. However, the relationship between technological complexity and regional eco­ nomic growth has rarely been empirically investigated. Here, we address this pressing research gap by assessing the complexity of technological activities in 159 European NUTS 2 regions and relating it to their economic growth from 2000 to 2014. Our empirical results suggest that technological complexity is an important predictor of regional economic growth. A 10\% increase in complexity is associated with a 0.45\% GDP per capita growth. By showing that technological complexity is important for regional economic growth, our results fuel current policy debates about optimal regional policies such as the Smart Specialization strategy.},

However, for the first time in the literature, this study considers how the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) moderate the contribution of energy consumption to emissions for the four World Bank Income clusters. The system generalised methods of moments are applied to data for 109 countries from 1996 to 2016. Based on the main model (grouped clusters) estimations, the result revealed the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Also, an increase in air transport and consumption of energy releases more carbon emissions to the climate. Interestingly, ECI decreases carbon emission significantly while EPU does not have a significant impact. Moreover, the study revealed that ECI moderated the impact of other variables on emission, but EPU is not a significant moderator. Furthermore, a comparative analysis among the four incomes suggests that the EKC hypothesis holds only in the high-income clusters; ECI is a significant predictor of carbon emission in the four clusters, but it only decreases the emission in high-income clusters. This corroborates the debate on climate change and the productive capacity of high-income countries. Given the foregoing, several policy measures were recommended.},

The empirical evidence reveals the association between economic complexity and CO2 emissions is inverted-U and further N-shaped relationship.

The empirical results also authenticate the pollution haven hypothesis since high FDI is the culprit to increase environmental degradation in the PIIGS economies.

Despite the fact that research has been conducted on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), few researchers have analyzed this in the light of economic complexity. Thus, the current research assesses the effect of economic complexity on ­CO2 emissions in the MINT nations while taking into account the role of financial development, economic growth, and energy consumption for the period between 1990 and 2018. Using the novel method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) with fixed effects, an inverted U-shape interrelationship is found between economic growth and ­CO2 emissions, thus validating the EKC hypothesis. Energy consumption and economic complexity increase C­ O2 emissions significantly from the 1st to 9th quantiles. Furthermore, there is no significant interconnection between financial development and ­CO2 emissions across all quantiles (1st to 9th). The outcomes of the causality test reveal a feedback causal connection between economic growth and C­ O2, while a unidirectional causality is established from economic complexity and energy use to C­ O2 emissions in the MINT nations. Based on the findings, we believe that governments should stimulate the financial sector to provide domestic credit facilities to industrialists, investors, and other business enterprises on more favorable terms so that innovative technologies for environmental protection can be implemented with other policy recommendations.},

            Urbanization plays a crucial role in the economic development of every country. The mutual relationship between the urbanization of any country and its economic productive structure is far from being understood. We analyzed the historical evolution of product exports for all countries using the World Trade Web with respect to patterns of urbanization from 1995 to 2010. Using the evolving framework of economic complexity, we reveal that a country’s economic development in terms of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with the urbanization process during the early stages of its economic development and growth. Meanwhile in urbanized countries, the reciprocal relation between economic growth and urbanization fades away with respect to its later stages, becoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources where urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.},

  abstract = {China is experiencing a rapid urbanization that is unprecedented in human history. This has significantly improved the well-being of residents, but has also caused serious environmental problems in the BeijingTianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA). Therefore, the study constructed the indexes of urbanization and environmental pollution based on the existing literature, used the analytic hierarchy process, entropy method and the principle of minimum information entropy to obtain the subjective, objective and comprehensive weights of the evaluation indexes respectively, and took BTHUA as an example to study the effects of urbanization elements and subsystems on environmental pollution from 2000 to 2015 by using geographically and temporally weighted regression model. This study reached the following conclusions. (1) The urbanization index increased rapidly from 0.157 in 2000 to 0.438 by 2015. National policies have significant impacts on environmental protection in urban agglomerations. (2) The service industry level, fiscal revenue, resident income, education level, Internet application were factors that reduced environmental pollution. The urbanization rate, population agglomeration, economic development, industrial development, urban construction, and transportation construction were factors that aggravated environmental pollution. (3) The impacts of urbanization on environmental pollution fluctuated periodically, with the period of fluctuation being consistent with China's five-year plan. National policy has significantly promoted the coordinated development of urbanization and environmental protection, although there was a lag effect. The effects of the trends in population, economic, social, spatial, and comprehensive urbanization factors on environmental pollution were basically the same, but the degree of each effect differed. (4) Urbanization improved the environmental quality in mountainous areas, but aggravated the degree of local environmental pollution in plains and coastal areas. The rate of urbanization of urban agglomerations differed, with the rate of urbanization lagging behind in mountainous areas, whereas it was excessive in plains and coastal areas.},

  abstract = {Technology innovation plays an increasingly prominent role in addressing global environmental challenges. In particular, environmental technology innovation (environmental innovation) is the most powerful and realistic alternative to achieve environmental sustainability and sustainable development. A better understanding of how environmental innovation affects the environment and how the effect differs by country is needed. This study analyzes how environmental innovation affects environmental improvement by a dynamic panel model using the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation. We use panel data from 33 high-income countries and 36 middle-income countries for the period 1996--2011, to compare their environmental pollution patterns, and determine how environmental innovation affects air pollution reduction as measured by sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The results reveal that environmental innovation improves the environment in some countries over time. The effect is particularly beneficial in high income countries. It is evident that environmental innovations reduce SO2 and CO2 emissions in high-income countries with time interval, while it does not in middle-income countries. The study also identifies that the relationship between per capita income and SO2 and CO2 emissions has a different pattern between high- and middle-income countries. The inverted U-shaped pattern supporting the hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) exists in high-income countries. The examination of the trade effect on pollution emissions provides mixed results; however, trade clearly increases SO2 and CO2 emissions in middle-income countries. This study contributes to empirical literatures on the effect of environmental innovation on environmental improvement. And it has significant implications for understanding the importance of direction and role of environmental innovation for environmental sustainability and sustainable development.},

The studied region has an important feature of less industrialization and are having high advantage of biodiversity. As ecological footprint is a comprehensive indicator of environmental deterioration because it assesses the impact of all human activities on nature. This research examines the effect of economic complexity and the natural resources rents on the per capita ecological footprint in Latin America. To assess the sensitivity of the parameters and to capture the impact of the growth in the structure of the industrial sector for the region, the study includes globalization, inequality, internal credit and trade as additional covariates. The theoretical framework comprises the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and for the methodology the quantile regression approach, proposed by Canay (2011), Powell (2016) and Machado and Santos Silva (2019), has been used in this study. The study found that the impact of economic complexity and the natural resources rents is heterogeneous throughout the distribution on the ecological footprint. It is also observed that the level of inequality for the utilization of region-specific climatic distribution of natural resources, increases the ecological footprint in the lower quantiles, while in the upper quantiles, it decreases the same. This study provides a new approach to analyze the degradation of environment in countries with high dependence on natural resources rents and highincome inequality.},

According to panel URTs and panel cointegration tests, all variables are stationary at the first difference and cointegrated, respectively. The FMOLS results reveal that the impact of economic complexity on carbon emissions is positive and statistically significant in the long run. In addition, the environmental Kuznets curve theory is also validated in these economies.

The overall results indicate that economic growth and financial development contribute to carbon dioxide emissions across all quantiles, while information and communication technologies significantly mitigate the level of carbon dioxide emissions only at lower emissions quantiles. Moreover, the results confirm the presence of the EKC hypothesis. Interestingly, the effect of economic growth and information and communication technologies on carbon dioxide emissions is lowest in magnitude at lower quantiles and highest at higher quantiles of carbon dioxide emissions. The empirical findings of DH panel heterogenous causality test confirm bidirectional causality between the model parameters, indi­ cating that any policy intervention concerning explanatory variables significantly causes carbon dioxide emis­ sions and vice versa.

The study’s empirical results illustrate the existence of a positive interconnection between digitalization and FLFP in sample countries. In addition, education and GDP play an essential role in furthering FLFP in the long run. A similar interconnection is observed in the short period. However, the magnitude of the short-run impacts is smaller than the long-run impacts.

              Growing aging populations pose a threat to global health because of the social and psychological challenges they experience. To mitigate this, many countries promote hobby engagement to support and improve mental health. Yet, it remains unclear whether there is consistency in benefits across different national settings. We harmonized measures of hobby engagement and multiple aspects of mental wellbeing across 16 nations represented in five longitudinal studies (
              N
               = 93,263). Prevalence of hobby engagement varied substantially across countries, from 51.0\% of Spanish respondents to 96.0\% of Danish respondents. Fixed effects models and multinational meta-analyses were applied to compare the longitudinal associations between hobbies and mental wellbeing. Independent of confounders, having a hobby was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (pooled coefficient = −0.10; 95\% confidence intervals (CI) = −0.13, −0.07), and higher levels of self-reported health (pooled coefficient = 0.06; 95\% CI = 0.03, 0.08), happiness (pooled coefficient = 0.09; 95\% CI = 0.06, 0.13) and life satisfaction (pooled coefficient = 0.10; 95\% CI = 0.08, 0.12). Further analyses suggested a temporal relationship. The strength of these associations, and prevalence of hobby engagement, were correlated with macrolevel factors such as life expectancy and national happiness levels but overall, little variance in findings was explained by country-level factors ({\textless}9\%). Given the relative universality of findings, ensuring equality in hobby engagement within and between countries should be a priority for promoting healthy aging.},

The impact of food inflation on the risk of child undernutrition is not well understood, however. This study explores the potential impacts of food inflation on wasting and stunting among 1.27 million pre-school children from 44 developing countries. On average, a 5 percent increase in the real price of food increases the risk of wasting by 9 percent and severe wasting by 14 percent. These risks apply to young infants, suggesting a prenatal pathway, as well as to older children who typically experience a deterioration in diet quality in the wake of food inflation. Male children and children from poor and rural landless households are more severely impacted. Food inflation during pregnancy and the first year after birth also increases the risk of stunting for children 2-5 years of age. This evidence provides a strong rationale for interventions to prevent food inflation and mitigate its impacts on vulnerable children and their mothers.},

	abstract = {Continuous economic growth and the rise in energy consumption are linked with environmental pollution. Demand for health care expenditure increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is interesting in modeling the nexus between public and private health expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. To this end, the present study analyzed the nexus between public and private health care expenditure, economic growth, and environmental pollution for 36 Asian countries for the period 1991--2017. FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression analysis confirm the EKC hypothesis in Asia. Besides, FMOLS and quantile regressions reached the reducing effects of government and private health expenditures on CO2 emissions. While quantile regression results show that public and private health expenditures can mitigate CO2 emissions; however, these results differ for various levels of CO2. Findings of quantile regression show a significant impact of both public and private health expenditures in reducing CO2 at the 50th and 75th quantiles but results are insignificant for the 25th quantile. Overall, the paper concludes that both government and private health sectors'expenditures caused CO2 emissions to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO2 emissions is greater than that of the government health sector. The concluding remark is that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. Hence, the health administrators need to increase public and private health expenditures with an effective cost-service and energy-efficient management approach to reach sustainable health services and a sustainable environment in Asia.},

The study examines a cointegrating polynomial regression (CPR) for a panel data framework as well as for simple time series of individual countries. In the model is also included the variable ‘energy intensity’ as main determinant of carbon emissions. Depending on economic complexity, the CO2 emissions pattern was found to exhibit an inverted U-shaped curve: in the initial phase, pollution increases when countries augment the complexity of the products they export using and after a turning point the rise of economic complexity suppress the pollutant emissions. The panel cointegration test indicates a long-run relationship between economic complexity, energy intensity and carbon emissions. It was also found that a rise of 10\% of energy intensity would lead to a 3.9\% increase in CO2 emissions. The quadratic model incorporating ECI is validated for the whole panel as well as for six countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The graphical representation of the EKC in these countries is discussed. Policy implications are also included.},

To this end, the study employs a recently developed Fourier ARDL procedure and time-varying causality test over the period 1965--2016 to analyze the short- and longterm relationships between economic growth, economic complexity index, energy consumption, and ecological footprint. The findings of the Fourier ARDL procedure confirm the existence of cointegration among the series. Moreover, the results of this study demonstrate that energy consumption and ecological complexity increase ecological footprint in both the short- and long term. However, the short-term elasticity of economic growth is smaller than the long-term elasticity, implying that the EKC hypothesis is not valid for China. This finding is robust as it is confirmed by the time-varying causality test. The overall results illustrate that economic complexity has an increasing impact on ecological footprint, and economic growth is not effective to solve environmental problems in China. Therefore, the Chinese government should encourage a more environmentally friendly production process and cleaner technologies in exports to reduce environmental pollution.},

How does the migration of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry-, occupation-, and location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one establishment to the next, using a dataset summarizing the individual work history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms—firms operating in an industry that was not present in a region—because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are workers with experience in a related industry and with work experience in the same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than for nonpioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry-specific knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micromechanisms underlying regional economic diversification.},

Environmental degradation and economic growth are thought to be related in a non-linear manner, following an inverted-U pattern called the ‘Environmental Kuznets Curve’ (EKC). Despite the many studies seeking empirical support for this relationship, the literature does not provide conclusive findings. By presenting the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) as an explanatory variable, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive analysis of EKC from 86 countries with different development levels, covering the period between 1971 and 2014. Different statistical estimation techniques were used, including an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model, dynamic panel data techniques, and the Sasabuchi–Lind–Mehlum (SLM) test. The results show no clear evidence supporting the idea of EKC, neither for production volumes nor for production sophistication, as captured by ECI. Nonetheless, when ECI increases, pollution levels drop monotonously only for developed countries.},

We refer to the extended theories of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), stating that environmental pollution follows an inverted u-shaped course with respect to economic complexity. Using comprehensive data of 27 countries for the period 1995–2017, our results show that the EKC can be found for countries whose complexity rose over time. Additionally, since the results for productionbased and consumption-based ­CO2 emissions are similar, we can discard emissions offshoring as a major explaining factor. Consequently, our findings suggest that more complex products have influenced the u-shaped course of the EKC. However, as the turning point is associated with high levels of pollution, our estimates imply that complexity may even exacerbate environmental issues in the short and middle run in less developed countries.},

	abstract = {Upgrading economic structures and producing less pollution-intensive goods are indispensable for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that produce 41\% of global ­CO2 emissions. Economic complexity (ECC), which measures the sophistication of productivity and economic structure, has important environmental repercussions. Theoretically, the environmental impacts of economic complexity at higher levels and lower levels of complexity vary from each other. However, the majority of previous studies have overlooked these theoretical underpinnings while assessing the environmental repercussions of economic complexity. In addition, technological competencies are necessary to boost the economic complexity levels. Accordingly, this study uncovers the non-linear effects of economic complexity on ­CO2 emissions including technology, population density, and economic growth in a STIRPAT model. To this end, the panel data from 1992 to 2018 is analyzed using the Continuously Updated Fully Modified method (CuP-FM) in the context of BRICS. The long-run results uncovered that ­CO2 emissions intensify at a lower level of economic complexity. On the flip side, a higher level of economic complexity is beneficial in mitigating C­ O2 in BRICS. Hence, the economic complexity and ­CO2 connections follow an inverted U-shaped curve. The results also disclosed that expanding the level of technology lessens ­CO2 and stimulates the quality of the environment. Further, population density and economic growth are evidenced to intensify C­ O2. Moreover, economic complexity and technology Granger cause C­ O2. Lastly, strategies are directed in the context of Sustainable Development Goals 9 and 13 to control C­ O2 emissions by upgrading technology and products complexity.},

It posits that economic complexity, by providing the economy with the ability to reduce macroeconomic shocks, is associated with lower inflation. Economic complexity is inferred from the overall sophistication and mix of a country’s exports. Complex economies are highly diversified and export a large number of less ubiquitous products. Using a sample of 94 countries for the period 1970 to 2014, the impact of economic complexity on inflation is estimated using the Arellano and Bond generalized method of moments estimation procedure. The empirical results show that economic complexity has a negative causal impact on inflation. This effect is statistically significant, quantitatively large, and robust. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest that development driven by economic diversification, a critical component of economic complexity, rather than export specialization, is more likely to promote low inflation, a crucial objective of macroeconomic policy.},

            To achieve inclusive green growth, countries need to consider a multiplicity of economic, social, and environmental factors. These are often captured by metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data combine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology, and research combine to explain inclusive green growth.},

The export baskets of ASEAN countries are shifting from low complexity products to medium and high complexity products. We also evaluate the export quality of countries using weighted product complexity, which shows that the export quality of ASEAN countries has improved. The regression results show that economic complexity has positive effects on economic growth, and they also show that infrastructure, education level, trade openness, and financial openness contribute to the development of countries. However, the impact extent of economic complexity varies among different ASEAN countries; for example, its impact is weaker in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia but stronger in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines.},

	abstract = {Cities host diverse people and their mixing is the engine of prosperity. In turn, segregation and inequalities are common features of most cities and locations that enable the meeting of people with different socio-economic status are key for urban inclusion. In this study, we adopt the concept of economic complexity to quantify the ability of locations – on the level of neighborhoods and amenities – to attract diverse visitors from various socio-economic backgrounds across the city. Utilizing the spatial distribution of point of interests inside the city of Budapest, Hungary, we construct the measures of amenity complexity based on the local portfolio of diverse and non-ubiquitous amenities. We investigate mixing patterns at visited third places by tracing the daily mobility of individuals and characterizing their socio-economic status by the real-estate price of their home locations. Results suggest that measures of ubiquity and diversity of amenities do not, but amenity complexity correlates with the diversity of visitors to neighborhoods and to actual amenities alike. We demonstrate that, in this monocentric city, amenity complexity is correlated with the relative geographic centrality of locations, which in itself is a strong predictor of socio-economic mixing. Our work combines urban mobility data with economic complexity thinking to show that the diversity of non-ubiquitous amenities, central locations, and the potentials for socio-economic mixing are interrelated.},

	abstract = {The largest contributor to environmental deterioration, the carbon footprint, arises from excessive fossil fuel consumption. Meanwhile, international experts note that despite the positive dynamics in the issue of making commitments to carbon-zero targets, most companies around the globe do not have a clear plan or strategy to achieve environment-based targets. This study addresses sustainable development goals (SDGs) concerning clean energy usage, sustainability, and the environment. Hence, this study investigates the impacts of the economic complexity index (ECI), energy productivity (EPD), renewable energy electricity generation (REEG), and environment-based patents on ecological footprints (ECFP) to attain a carbon-zero environment and SDGs for forty-five exporting countries from 1990 to 2020. An extensive exploration into the connection amongst the explored variables shows that the rises in ECI, EPD, and REEG help subside ECFP in the short-term and long-term estimations. Besides, the results show a bidirectional and unidirectional causality from ECFP to REEG and EPD, respectively. The key practical policies of this work are building modernized tax systems with progressive tax policies, better tax collection, private SDGs financing with incentives regulations, promising project planning on green technologies, and accessibility of grants from global organizations and private sectors to invest in SDGs and a carbon-zero environment target.},

These are often captured by metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data combine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology, and research combine to explain inclusive green growth.},

This dataset updates the Statistics Canada World Trade Database as described in Feenstra, Lipsey, and Bowen (1997), which was available for years 1970-1992. In that database, Statistics Canada had revised the United Nations trade data, mostly derived from the export side, to fit the Canadian trade classification and in some cases to add data not available from the export reports. In contrast, in the new NBER-UN dataset we give primacy to the trade flows reported by the importing country, whenever they are available, assuming that these are more accurate than reports by the exporters. If the importer report is not available for a country-pair, however, then the corresponding exporter report is used instead. Corrections and additions are made to the United Nations data for trade flows to and from the United States, exports from Hong Kong and China, and imports into many other countries.},

The results of hedonic price analysis at the ex-vessel level of the value chain indicate substantial diﬀerences in ﬁsh quality as Atlantic cod caught with longlines obtain price premiums of 15.0 \% and 12.6 \% compared with bottom trawling and Danish seining, respectively, holding other variables constant. For haddock, longlining obtains a price premium of 20.0 \% compared with Danish seining and 13.3 \% compared with bottom trawling. However, despite better quality and prices, the costs of ﬁshing are substantially higher for longliners than for bottom trawlers and Danish seiners, which explains the diﬀerences in proﬁtability favoring the more technically eﬃcient bottom trawlers and Danish seiners. Policy implications are discussed considering trade-oﬀs between ﬁsh quality, ex-vessel prices and vessel proﬁtability. In a highly regulated ﬁshery such as the Norwegian groundﬁsh ﬁshery, with individual vessel and vessel group quotas based on historical ﬁshing rights, policy intervention is important for optimal use of limited ﬁsh stocks but is not necessarily straightforward.},

These inferences are often done without adequately considering (or understanding) the assumptions one makes when claiming these inferences. Of particular concern is when there are unmodeled nonlinear and/or interaction effects. With such unmodeled multiplicative effects, inferences based on a main effects model are not merited. On the other hand, when these effects are properly modeled, complex multivariate analyses can be "partitioned" into distinct components to ease interpretation. In this paper, we highlight when conditional inferences are contaminated by other features of the model and identify the conditions under which effects can be partitioned. We also reveal a strategy for partitioning multivariate effects into uncontaminated blocks using visualizations. This approach simplifies multivariate analyses immensely, without oversimplifying the analysis.},

The results provide no evidence of a total validation of EKC predictions. However, CO2 emissions are found to increase with income per capita. The overall estimations strongly reveal that renewable energy, with a negative eﬀect on CO2 emissions, coupled with an increasing longrun eﬀect, remains an eﬃcient substitute for the conventional fossil-fuelled energy. Nonetheless, the impact of renewable energy is outweighed by primary energy consumption in both the short and long run, entailing more global synergy for outpacing the environmental challenges.},

To this end, we leverage on second- generational panel methods for its superiority over first-generation model over annual frequency data from 1990 to 2018 for the case of BRICS countries. Empirical findings show that positive changes in trade openness and economic complexity stimulate environmental quality.

One criticism related to the existing literature is the selection of data. The majority of studies use aggregate energy consumption. The other criticism is the selection of panel estimation techniques. Almost all studies use panel methods that ignore cross-sectional dependence. To fulﬁll the mentioned gaps in the literature, this empirical study aims to investigate the impacts of renewable and nonrenewable energy, real income and trade openness on CO2 emissions in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model for the European Union over the period 1980e2012 by employing panel estimation techniques robust to cross-sectional dependence. By using the dynamic ordinary least squares estimator, we show that renewable energy and trade mitigate carbon emissions while non-renewable energy increases CO2 emissions, and the EKC hypothesis is supported. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin non-causality approach indicates that there is bidirectional causality between renewable energy and carbon emissions, and unidirectional causality running from real income to carbon emissions, from CO2 emissions to nonrenewable energy, and from trade openness to CO2 emissions.},

Results suggest that meaningful EKCs exist only for local air pollutants whilst indicators with a more global, or indirect, impact either increase monotonically with income or else have predicted turning points at high per capita income levels with large standard errors – unless they have been subjected to a multilateral policy initiative. Two other findings are also made: that concentration of local pollutants in urban areas peak at a lower per capita income level than total emissions per capita; and that transport-generated local air pollutants peak at a higher per capita income level than total emissions per capita.

This paper examines whether progress has been made on both understanding the EKC phenomenon and on addressing the various criticisms raised against some of the empirical studies and their interpretation in the policy literature.

Some attempts have also been made to examine the history of the relationship in individual countries. The econometric techniques used have improved. However, empirical decompositions of the EKC into proximate or underlying causes are either limited in scope or non-systematic, and explicit testing of the various theoretical models has not yet been attempted.},

The decoupling analysis results show that the decou­ pling states in China’s cities generally improved first and then deteriorated in 2002–2017. The proportion of cities experiencing deterioration of decoupling states had increased to 60.00\% by 2014–2017, and cities with a higher economic development level generally had more serious deterioration. The empirical test results support the N-shaped EKC hypothesis of MSW, which can explain why the decoupling state changed from improvement to deterioration. The difference of the economic level of sample cities (which determines their position on EKC) can also explain the spatial heterogeneity of the decoupling state and its changes; for example, the proportion of cities that have crossed the inflection point of Tapio decoupling elasticity (the per capita GDP is 13,130.89 yuan) to enter the deterioration stage is highest (100/101) in the economically developed eastern region, and is lowest (66/75) in the economically backward western region of China. In general, the empirical results of EKC can effectively support and explain the results of decoupling analysis.},

	abstract = {The relationship between entrepreneurship, output and environmental quality receives considerable attention from academics and policymakers, as society searches for solutions leading to environmental sustainability. Given this context, the current study contributes to this discussion by explaining how entrepreneurship and diﬀerent sectoral outputs can help resolve the environmental problems of global socio-economic systems. So, we used data for 69 countries split across four homogeneous income-based panels: high-income, upper-middleincome, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. Long-run elasticities suggest that (i) the rate of environmental damage due to the growth of sectoral outputs is much higher in the high-income sample; (ii) compared to output from other sectors, services makes the highest contribution to environmental degradation in high-income countries but its contribution in the other country samples is negative; indicating that a move to services economy would be beneﬁcial for these countries; (iii) with the exception of the high-income sample, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between output growth and environmental degradation across country samples and sectors; (iv) the contribution of entrepreneurial activity to environmental degradation is lower in high-income countries compared to other country samples; and (v) entrepreneurship activity in highincome countries initially degrades the environment but then improves environmental quality after a certain level, that is, an inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurship and environmental pollution. The ﬁndings are sensitive to diﬀerent income groups and sectoral analyzes. In particular, these empirical ﬁndings aid sound economic policymaking for improving environmental quality and sustainable economic development.},

	abstract = {China has proposed its ambitious cap targets of carbon emissions in both carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) and carbon scale (gross carbon emissions). Since mining sector is the foundation of the whole industrial production as well as a carbon intensive sector, it is critical to uncover the key driving factors on inducing corresponding carbon emissions so that appropriate mitigation policies can be raised. Under such a circumstance, this paper aims to fill such a research gap by employing a novel index decomposition method, namely, Generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM), so that the driving factors of energy-related carbon emissions changes in China's mining sector and its five sub-sectors over the period of 1999--2013 can be identified. In addition, a scenario analysis approach is applied in order to seek the feasible mitigation pathways on China's mining sector and its five sub-sectors. The results indicate that output scale effect is the primary contributor of the increase in carbon emissions of both mining sector and its five sub-sectors and energy use effect also plays a positive role, while carbon intensity effect contributes most to the decrease in carbon emissions. All sub-sectors have achieved the target of 45% carbon intensity reduction except the extraction industry of petroleum and natural gas. Nevertheless, more efforts should be made for the whole mining sector in order to achieve the 2030 peak target of carbon scale.},

  abstract = {In the context of China's efforts to promote green development, how to improve the green development effi\- ciency (GDE) has become an increasingly important research topic. Promoting the transformation towards a knowledge- and technology-intensive economic structure may be an important way to improve the GDE. Therefore, this study examines the impact of economic structural transformation represented by economic complexity on China's GDE. This study first measures the economic complexity index (ECI) and GDE of China's provinces using the method of reflections and data envelopment analysis window model, then examines the impact of the ECI on China's GDE based on a panel data model. It further analyses the contribution of ECI to regional differences in GDE and the mechanism of the effect of ECI on GDE using the regression-based Shapley decomposition analysis approach and a mediating effect model, respectively. Five conclusions are obtained as follows. Firstly, the ECI in China decreased from the east to the west, while the GDE shows the characteristics of `a higher GDE in the east and south and a lower GDE in the west and north'. Secondly, the empirical results show that the ECI has a significant positive impact on the GDE, and the results of the robustness tests support this finding. This indicates that increasing economic complexity plays an important role in promoting the green development of China's provinces. Thirdly, significant regional differences exist in the impact of economic complexity on the GDE. Fourthly, the decomposition results of regional differences in the GDE suggest that economic complexity is a primary factor that causes the differences in the GDE among China's provinces. Fifthly, the estimation results of the mediating effect model indicate that increasing economic complexity can improve the GDE by enhancing innovation and human capital levels. These findings suggest that China can promote regional green development by developing policies related to enhancing economic complexity and fully releasing the effects of economic complexity on innovation and human capital.},

Exploring whether RETI is beneficial to the improvement of carbon emission efficiency and how the market environment affects the role of RETI on carbon emission efficiency is critical to the design of effective policies. Therefore, based on the data from 25 provinces in China from 2002 to 2015, the Tobit fixed-effect model and the panel threshold model are used to investigate the impact and the mechanism of RETI on total factor carbon performance index (TCPI) from a market perspective. The results show that: (1) RETI can effectively improve TCPI, but this effect is affected by market factors; (2) With the reduction of market segmentation or the increase of market potential, the improvement effect of RETI on TCPI is significantly enhanced; (3) The panel threshold model further verifies that the impact of RETI on TCPI has a significant single threshold effect in terms of market segmentation and market potential; (4) There is an inverted ``U-shaped'' relationship between market segmentation and TCPI, and the increase of market potential is conducive to the improvement of TCPI.

Taking cognizance of heterogeneity and the ``ratchet effect,'' this paper adopts the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework as a starting point and re-estimates the relationship using different panel date models. The main results are obtained by dynamic panel threshold regression models, which divide a balanced panel dataset of 73 countries over the period of 1971--2010 into four groups according to their annual income levels. The key results are: (1) in the low-income group, urbanization decreases energy consumption but increases CO2 emissions; (2) in the middle-/low-income and high-income groups, industrialization decreases energy consumption but increases CO2 emissions, while urbanization significantly increases both energy consumption and CO2 emissions; (3) for the middle-/high-income group, urbanization does not significantly affect energy consumption, but does hinder the growth of emissions; while industrialization was found to have an insignificant impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions; (4) from the population perspective, it produces positive effects on energy consumption, and also increases emissions except for the high-income group. These novel methodology and findings reveal that different development strategies of urbanization and industrialization should be pursued depending on the levels of income in a bid to conserve energy and reduce emissions.},

  abstract = {Sectors contribute differently to the total level of CO2 emissions per capita, since they are heterogeneous in terms of GDP structure. This work investigates the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis considering a set of twelve of the fourteen OPEC countries. It contributes to previous literature exploring the Environmental Kuznets Curve relationship by analysing how economic activity sector diversification impacts the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions, addressing an important identified gap. To address this gap, annual data from 1992 to 2015 is used. A panel cross-section analysis is provided between countries, and for the seven considered sectors, is estimated through panel corrected standard errors and convergence estimations are presented. Conclusions point to the relocation of pollution-intensive sectors to almost all of the OPEC countries. For all countries, a U-shaped relationship is evidenced, implying that economic growth in oil-producing and exporting countries increases environmental degradation. While energy consumption increases environmental damage, trade openness seems to have a significant and negative effect over emissions, leading to environmental improvements. This study points out that OPEC countries will have increased challenges facing them in terms of environmental degradation and only a few economic activity sectors can conduct environmental improvements through growth. The inclusion of oil prices increased coefficients magnitude. Probably these sectors are already allocating more labour and capital in projects and investments on renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy savings, substituting fossil fuels like oil.},

	abstract = {The leaders of African nations have committed to the establishment of the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) over the coming years. Improved links among the African nations, via increased intra-regional trade, have been considered as an essential mechanism to produce desired growth run-overs and to support regional economic improvement. However, remarkable theoretical and empirical evidence has shown that increased trade might damage the environment and therefore may hinder the effort towards sustainable development and poverty reduction on the continent. The present paper seeks to investigate and test the impact of intra-Africa trade using two measurements of environmental pollutants, namely CO2 and MP10 whilst integrating economic growth, and energy consumption. The study used a panel dataset regarding 46 African countries over the period 1990–2017. To carry out the empirical analysis, the latest panel estimation techniques were employed. More specifically, and for the urbaneness purpose, we employed a parametric technique, which is dynamic OLS, and a non-parametric approach which is FMOLS. The results of both methods suggested that intra-Africa trade improved environmental quality on the continent. In addition, the results confirmed the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The findings also indicated that whilst the consumption of energy played a vital role in the deterioration of the environment, its impact remained marginal. Overall the results implied that intra-regional trade and the environment quality were mutually supportive in Africa.},

Based on a balanced panel data of 31 provinces in China over the period 1997–2010, this study empirically examines the relationships among urbanization, economic growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the national and regional levels using panel cointegration and vector error correction model and Granger causality tests. Results showed that urbanization, economic growth and CO2 emissions are integrated of order one. Urbanization contributes to economic growth, both of which increase CO2 emissions in China and its eastern, central and western regions. The impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in the western region was larger than that in the eastern and central regions. But economic growth had a larger impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region than that in the central and western regions. Panel causality analysis revealed a bidirectional long-run causal relationship among urbanization, economic growth and CO2 emissions, indicating that in the long run, urbanization does have a causal effect on economic growth in China, both of which have causal effect on CO2 emissions. At the regional level, we also found a bidirectional long-run causality between land urbanization and economic growth in eastern and central China. These results demonstrated that it might be difficult for China to pursue carbon emissions reduction policy and to control urban expansion without impeding economic growth in the long run. In the short-run, we observed a unidirectional causation running from land urbanization to CO2 emissions and from economic growth to CO2 emissions in the eastern and central regions. Further investigations revealed an inverted N-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in China, not supporting the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Our empirical findings have an important reference value for policy-makers in formulating effective energy saving and emission reduction strategies for China.},

We evaluate panel data of the carbon intensity of human wellbeing (CIWB) to measure environmental sustainability and human well-being for 30 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2016. We then employ a spatial model to test the environmental Kuznets curve. The CIWB is an important indicator that incorporates the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability. The coefﬁcients of GDP, squared GDP, and cubic GDP are À1.043, 0.123, and À0.0045, respectively, indicating that the relationship between CIWB and economic growth is an inverted-N shape. In other words, as GDP increases from low to high, the CIWB ﬁrst decreases, then increases for a long period until it reaches a turning point, and declines thereafter. GDP per capita at the two turning points are 850 yuan and 110,000 yuan, respectively. In the long run, economic growth is expected to have a positive effect on sustainable development; however, currently, environmental policies are needed to offset unintended environmental harm. Analysis of spatial evolution and multiplier spatial effects show that spatial disparity and clustering exist simultaneously. This suggests that overall planning for the big picture and cooperative development between adjacent provinces could help to handle regional environmental problems.},

We found evidence favorable to the U-shaped EKC for 5 Middle East countries, whereas an inverted U-shaped curve was identiﬁed for only 3 Middle East countries. Furthermore, there appear to be no causal links between income and CO2 emissions for the other 4 countries. Regarding the direction of causality, there appears to be a unidirectional causality from economic growth to energy consumption in the short-run; in the longrun, however, the unidirectional causality chain runs from energy consumption and economic growth to CO2 emissions. We also suggest some crucial policy implications depending on these results.},

	abstract = {In the context of remarkable economic growth and financial development in the emerging economies of East Asia, this paper attempts to shed light on the ecological consequences (CO2 emission) of economic growth, foreign direct investment and financial development in the selected ASEAN-5 economies. Drawing on the data from 1982 to 2014, we employed a set of quantitative techniques for panel data analysis which entailed Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) and Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) approaches. Our findings indicate that financial and economic development, as well as FDI, have a statistically significant long-run co-integrating relationship with environmental degradation (CO2 emissions) in the under analysis economies. It showed that in ASEAN-5 countries, economic growth, financial development and FDI leads to an increase in environmental degradation. The quadratic term for economic growth showed a negative impact on environmental degradation i.e. Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Our key findings manifest and emphasise the importance of appropriate policies for more inclusive economic and financial development and sustainable foreign direct investment which does not impede on the environment.},

However, at a disaggregated, country-level, the relationship between GDP and CO2 is characterized by much diversity among CEE countries, namely: N-shaped, inverted-N, U-shaped, inverted-U, monotonic, or no statistical link. Thus, despite an aggregated upward trend, some CEE countries managed to secure both higher GDP and lower CO2 emissions. From a policy perspective, EU policymakers could pay more attention to these countries, and amend the current unique environmental policy to account for country-heterogeneities in order to support economic growth without damaging the environment.},

Ordinary quantile regression, implemented in the qreg command, is a popular, simple type of parametric quantile model. It is widely used but known to yield erratic estimates that often lead to uncertain inferences. Parametric quantile models overcome these limitations and extend modeling of conditional quantile functions beyond ordinary quantile regression. These models are flexible and efficient. qmodel can estimate virtually any possible linear or nonlinear parametric model because it allows the user to specify any combination of qmodel-specific built-in functions, standard mathematical and statistical functions, and substitutable expressions. We illustrate the potential of parametric quantile models and the use of the qmodel command and its postestimation commands through realand simulated-data examples that commonly arise in epidemiological and pharmacological research. In addition, this article may give insight into the close connection that exists between quantile functions and the true mathematical laws that generate data.},

	abstract = {Economic and demographic transitions led by the persistent increase in the per capita income have challenged the environmental conservation drive in most of the developing nations. Therefore, in recent years, policymakers emphasized the need for navigating the harmful impacts of economic growth endeavors on the established ecosystem. In this regard, the widespread usage of renewable energy solutions has helped in restoring the environmental quality in both developed and developing countries. Keeping this in mind, in the present study, we examined the long run and short-run impacts of per capita income, renewable energy, life expectancy, and population density on the ecological footprint in the eight developing countries of South and Southeast Asia from 1990 to 2015. In the selected nations, these variables appear to be the potential drivers of the ecological footprint. To calculate the common coefﬁcients, we have employed the cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach, as this approach handles the cross-sectional dependency issue efﬁciently and provides the short-run and long-run coefﬁcients. The long-run results supported the need for low pollution-intense energy resources because the association between per capita income and ecological footprint is found N-shaped. Further, the study established that the increased use of renewable energy has signiﬁcantly reduced the ecological footprint in the region. However, the increased population density has led to an increase in pollution emissions in these countries. Similarly, the impact of life expectancy on the ecological footprint is found positive but insigniﬁcant. Based on the ﬁndings, a multipronged policy framework has been designed, so that these nations can attain the objectives of certain sustainable development goals (SDGs).},

              The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network—who hires whose graduates as faculty—we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a

These properties make its outcomes incomparable across time and place and its economic interpretation problematic. We propose an alternative measure, the additive RCA, ranging from −1 to +1, with a symmetric distribution that centers on a stable mean of zero, independent of the classifications used. Statistical tests show the distribution of the additive index to be more stable. Besides, we propose an aggregate RCA, a regional specialization index, ranging from 0 for pure intra-industry trade to 1 for pure inter-industry trade. The same conclusions and proposals hold for the multiplicative location quotient (LQ), which is used as a measure for the revealed locational attractiveness of certain regions or countries for certain types of industry.},

The product space (PS) framework developed in recent seminal works by economists and physicists suggests that path-dependence characterizes the evolution of the production basket (Hausmann and Klinger, 2007, Harvard University Center for International Development Working Paper \#146; Hidalgo et al., 2007, Science Magazine, 317(5837), 482–487). These authors represent economies as sets of productive capabilities that can be combined in different ways to produce different products. Countries progressively change their production baskets and move toward goods that require capabilities that are already available; on the contrary radical structural change rarely happens. In this article, we analyze the evolution over time of the production baskets in 107 Italian provinces (NUTS 3) and perform the ﬁrst test on the PS hypothesis of path-dependence. We investigate whether new products entering the provincial production baskets are nonrandomly related to initial production baskets. We conﬁrm the general tendency of path-dependence but highlight at the same time that a sizable share of “new products” are an exception to this general pattern. These “random entries” over the PS are particularly interesting for industrial policy, since they represent radical deviations from the initial comparative advantage. In the ﬁnal part of the article, we investigate using parametric analysis the product and provincial characteristics that determine these deviations from the PS pattern.},

Such complexity is not always to the benefit of the accuracy of the forecast. Economic complexity constitutes a framework that builds on methods developed for the study of complex systems to construct approaches that are less demanding than standard macroeconomic ones in terms of data requirements, but whose accuracy remains to be systematically benchmarked. Here we develop a forecasting scheme that is shown to outperform the accuracy of the five-year forecast issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by more than 25\% on the available data. The model is based on effectively representing economic growth as a two-dimensional dynamical system, defined by GDP per capita and ‘fitness’, a variable computed using only publicly available product-level export data. We show that forecasting errors produced by the method are generally predictable and are also uncorrelated to IMF errors, suggesting that our method is extracting information that is complementary to standard approaches. We believe that our findings are of a very general nature and we plan to extend our validations on larger datasets in future works.},

We used external criteria of newness to examine convergent validity: In the postpublication peer review system of F1000Prime, experts assess papers whether the reported research fulfills these criteria (e.g., reports new findings). This study is based on 120,179 papers from F1000Prime published between 2000 and 2016. In the first part of the study we discuss the indicators. Based on the insights from the discussion, we propose alternate variants of disruption indicators. In the second part, we investigate the convergent validity of the indicators and the (possibly) improved variants. Although the results of a factor analysis show that the different variants measure similar dimensions, the results of regression analyses reveal that one variant (DI5) performs slightly better than the others.},

Concerns over the sustainable supply of EV-LIBs have been voiced, but only a few studies have investigated the international trade in EV-LIBs, which has a significant impact on EV production in the complicated and volatile international trade environment. To fill this gap, this study investigates the in­ ternational EV-LIB trade from a dynamic perspective. First, the dynamic structural evolution of the EV-LIB trade from 2012 to 2019 is explored from three perspectives, i.e., backbone structure, geospatial characteristics and trade communities, by constructing a weighted and directed network. Second, the hidden systemic risks in the international EV-LIB trade are revealed by the proposed trade network risk transmission (TNRT) model in two supply shortage scenarios. The results show a heterogeneous structure in the backbone network, and the trade barycenter is transitioning from Asia to Europe. In addition, a “robust-yet-fragile” characterization is revealed in the global EV-LIB trade network, and the hidden risks in leading EV-LIB exporter nodes and trade edges are uncovered. The findings will support authorities seeking effective strategies to manage the EV-LIB trade and build a more resilient trade system.},

	abstract = {A common element of market structure analysis is the spatial representation of ﬁrms’ competitive positions on maps. Such maps typically capture static snapshots in time. Yet, competitive positions tend to change. Embedded in such changes are ﬁrms’ trajectories, that is, the series of changes in ﬁrms’ positions over time relative to all other ﬁrms in a market. Identifying these trajectories contributes to market structure analysis by providing a forward-looking perspective on competition, revealing ﬁrms’ (re)positioning strategies and indicating strategy effectiveness. To unlock these insights, we propose EvoMap, a novel dynamic mapping framework that identiﬁes ﬁrms’ trajectories from high-frequency and potentially noisy data. We validate EvoMap via extensive simulations and apply it empirically to study the trajectories of more than 1,000 publicly listed ﬁrms over 20 years. We ﬁnd substantial changes in several ﬁrms’ positioning strategies, including Apple, Walmart, and Capital One. Because EvoMap accommodates a wide range of mapping methods, analysts can easily apply it in other empirical settings and to data from various sources.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental tasks in complex networks is detecting critical nodes whose removal significantly disrupts network connectivity. Identifying critical nodes can help analyze the topological characteristics of the network, such as vulnerability and robustness. This work considers a well-known critical node detection problem variant, Maximize the Number of Connected Components Problem, which aims to find a set of nodes whose removal maximizes the number of connected components and compares the centrality measures for detecting these nodes. While the existing literature focused only on small datasets, this work analyzes the widely used topology-based centrality measures on several synthetic and real-world networks. Our findings show that degree-like centralities are more relevant measures than path-like centralities for disconnecting networks into several connected components. However, our results also indicate that the traditional centrality measures cannot detect the most vital critical nodes. To overcome this drawback, a new centrality measure, namely Isolating Centrality, that aims to identify the nodes that significantly impact network connectedness is presented. The comprehensive computational study demonstrates that the proposed measure outperforms traditional measures in identifying critical nodes.},

Such applications have recently been at the forefront of global policy debates, such as about assigning responsibility for emissions embodied in internationally traded products. The new time series was constructed using advanced parallelized supercomputing resources, and signiﬁcantly advances the previous state of art because of four innovations. First, it is available as a continuous 20year time series of MRIO tables. Second, it distinguishes 187 individual countries comprising more than 15,000 industry sectors, and hence oﬀers unsurpassed detail. Third, it provides information just 1−3 years delayed therefore signiﬁcantly improving timeliness. Fourth, it presents MRIO elements with accompanying standard deviations in order to allow users to understand the reliability of data. These advances will lead to material improvements in the capability of applications that rely on input−output tables. The timeliness of information means that analyses are more relevant to current policy questions. The continuity of the time series enables the robust identiﬁcation of key trends and drivers of global environmental change. The high country and sector detail drastically improves the resolution of Life-Cycle Assessments. Finally, the availability of information on uncertainty allows policy-makers to quantitatively judge the level of conﬁdence that can be placed in the results of analyses.},

Responding to this demand, this paper selected the world multi-regional input-output (MRIO) table in 2009 as the bases for its attempt to explore global embodied metal flows in international trade by a combination of multi-regional input-output analysis and complex network analysis. Then we applied the complex network theory to study the structural characteristics of the global embodied metal flow network (GEMFN). The results show that, firstly, the global metal flow network has obvious small-world nature. One department only needs 2.702 steps to reach any other department in the network. Secondly, there are 10 communities in the network, which is highly correlated with the existing economic organizations. Thirdly, sectors weights among networks are very uneven. Some sectors are extremely important to a national economy, other do not. For example, China’s Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal is second to none in terms of scope and intensity of influence. Fourthly, only 0.45\% of flows account for 90\% of the total embodied metal from a sectoral perspective, while 77.68\% are intra-traded within economies from a regional perspective. Finally, some policy suggestions are given according to different economies and sectors.},

Depending on the definition and system boundary of the NEI, the mitigation options and priorities may vary. The territorial system boundary used by the UNFCCC has been critiqued for not including international transportation and potentially causing carbon leakage. To address these issues, past literature has argued in favour of using consumption-based NEI in climate policy. This article discusses several issues in moving from the standard production-based NEI to consumption-based NEI. First, two distinct accounting approaches for constructing consumption-based NEI are presented. The approaches differ in the allocation of intermediate consumption of imported products. Second, a consistent method of weighting production-based and consumption-based NEI is discussed. This is an extension of the previous literature on shared responsibility to NEI. Third, due to increased uncertainty and a wide system boundary it may be difficult to implement consumption-based NEI directly into climate policy. Several alternative options for incorporating consumption-based inventories into climate policy are discussed.},

	abstract = {Most countries show a relative decoupling of economic growth from domestic resource use, implying increased resource efﬁciency. However, international trade facilitates the exchange of products between regions with disparate resource productivity. Hence, for an understanding of resource efﬁciency from a consumption perspective that takes into account the impacts in the upstream supply chains, there is a need to assess the environmental pressures embodied in trade. We use EXIOBASE3, a new multiregional input-output database, to examine the rate of increase in resource efﬁciency, and investigate the ways in which international trade contributes to the displacement of pressures on the environment from the consumption of a population. We look at the environmental pressures of energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, material use, water use, and land use. Material use stands out as the only indicator growing in both absolute and relative terms to population and gross domestic product (GDP), while land use is the only indicator showing absolute decoupling from both references. Energy, GHG, and water use show relative decoupling. As a percentage of total global environmental pressure, we calculate the net impact displaced through trade rising from 23\% to 32\% for material use (1995–2011), 23\% to 26\% for water use, 20\% to 29\% for energy use, 20\% to 26\% for land use, and 19\% to 24\% for GHG emissions. The results show a substantial disparity between trade-related impacts for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. At the product group level, we observe the most rapid growth in environmental footprints in clothing and footwear. The analysis points to implications for future policies aiming to achieve environmental targets, while fully considering potential displacement effects through international trade.},

            A number of financial bubbles have occurred throughout history. The objective of this study was to identify the main similarities between Bitcoin price behavior during bubble periods and a number of historical bubbles. Once this had been carried out, we aimed to determine whether the solutions adopted in the past would be effective in the present to reduce investors’ risk in this digital asset. This study brings a new approach, as studies have previously been conducted analyzing the similarity of Bitcoin bubbles to other bubbles individually, but these were not conducted in such a broad manner, addressing different types of bubbles, and over such a broad time period. Starting from a dataset with 9967 records, a combined methodology was used. This consisted of an analysis of the standard deviations, the growth rates of the prices of the assets involved, the percentage increase in asset prices from the origin of the bubble to its peak and its fundamental value, and, finally, the bubble index. Lastly, correlation statistical analysis was performed. The results obtained from the combination of the above methods reveal the existence of certain similarities between the Bitcoin bubbles (2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021) and the tulip bubble (1634–1637) and the Mississippi bubble (1719–1720). We find that the vast majority of the measures taken to avoid past bubbles will not be effective now; this is due to the digital and decentralized nature of Bitcoin. A limitation of the study is the difficulty in making a comparison between bubbles that occurred at different historical points in time. However, the results obtained shed light and provide guidance on the actions to be taken by regulators to ensure the protection of investors in this digital asset.},

              Cities are main carbon emissions generators. Land use changes can not only affect terrestrial ecosystems carbon, but also anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, carbon monitoring at a spatial level is still coarse, and low-carbon land use encounters the challenge of being unable to adjust at the patch scale. This study addresses these limitations by using land-use data and various auxiliary data to explore new methods. The approach involves developing a high-resolution carbon monitoring model and investigating a patch-scale low-carbon land use model by integrating high carbon sink/source images with the Future Land Use Simulation model. Between 2000 and 2020, the results reveal an increasing trend in both carbon emissions and carbon sinks in the Shangyu district. Carbon sinks can only offset approximately 3\% of the total carbon emissions. Spatially, the north exhibits net carbon emissions, while the southern region functions more as a carbon sink. A total of 14.5\% of the total land area witnessed a change in land-use type, with the transfer-out of cropland constituting the largest area at 96.44 km
              2
              , accounting for 50\% of the total transferred area. Land-use transfer resulted in an annual increase of 77.72 × 10
              4
               t in carbon emissions between 2000 and 2020. Through land-use structure optimisation, carbon emissions are projected to increase by only 7154 t C/year from 2000 to 2030, significantly lower than the amount between 2000 and 2020. Further low-carbon land optimisation at the patch scale can enhance the carbon sink by 129.59 t C/year. The conclusion drawn is that there is considerable potential to reduce carbon emissions through land use control. The new methods developed in our study can effectively contribute to high-resolution carbon monitoring in spatial contexts and support low-carbon land use, promoting the application of low-carbon land use from theory to practice. This will provide technological guidance for land use planning, city planning, and so forth.},

            Despite global efforts to harmonize international trade statistics, our understanding of digital trade and its implications remains limited. Here, we introduce a method to estimate bilateral exports and imports for dozens of sectors starting from the corporate revenue data of large digital firms. This method allows us to provide estimates for digitally ordered and delivered trade involving digital goods (e.g. video games), productized services (e.g. digital advertising), and digital intermediation fees (e.g. hotel rental), which together we call digital products. We use these estimates to study five key aspects of digital trade. We find that, compared to trade in physical goods, digital product exports are more spatially concentrated, have been growing faster, and can offset trade balance estimates, like the United States trade deficit on physical goods. We also find that countries that have decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions tend to have larger digital exports and that digital exports contribute positively to the complexity of economies. This method, dataset, and findings provide a new lens to understand the impact of international trade in digital products.},

	abstract = {Is it possible to define a coefficient of correlation which is (a) as simple as the classical coefficients like Pearson’s correlation or Spearman’s correlation, and yet (b) consistently estimates some simple and interpretable measure of the degree of dependence between the variables, which is 0 if and only if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if one is a measurable function of the other, and (c) has a simple asymptotic theory under the hypothesis of independence, like the classical coefficients? This article answers this question in the affirmative, by producing such a coefficient. No assumptions are needed on the distributions of the variables. There are several coefficients in the literature that converge to 0 if and only if the variables are independent, but none that satisfy any of the other properties mentioned above. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
